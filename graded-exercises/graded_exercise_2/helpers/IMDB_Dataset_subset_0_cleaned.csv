review,sentiment
one of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 oz episode youll be hooked they are right as this is exactly what happened with me the first thing that struck me about oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence which set in right from the word go trust me this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid this show pulls no punches with regards to drugs sex or violence its is hardcore in the classic use of the word it is called oz as that is the nickname given to the oswald maximum security state penitentary it focuses mainly on emerald city an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards so privacy is not high on the agenda em city is home to manyaryans muslims gangstas latinos christians italians irish and moreso scuffles death stares dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away i would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldnt dare forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences forget charm forget romanceoz does not mess around the first episode i ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal i could not say i was ready for it but as i watched more i developed a taste for oz and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence not just violence but injustice crooked guards wholl be sold out for a nickel inmates wholl kill on order and get away with it well mannered middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience watching oz you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewingthats if you can get in touch with your darker side,positive
a wonderful little production the filming technique is very unassuming very oldtimebefore christ fashion and gives a comforting and sometimes discomforting sense of realism to the entire piece the actors are extremely well chosen michael sheen not only has got all the polari but he has all the voices down pat too you can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to williams diary entries not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece a masterful production about one of the great masters of comedy and his life the realism really comes home with the little things the fantasy of the guard which rather than use the traditional dream techniques remains solid then disappears it plays on our knowledge and our senses particularly with the scenes concerning orton and halliwell and the sets particularly of their flat with halliwells murals decorating every surface are terribly well done,positive
i thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a lighthearted comedy the plot is simplistic but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable even the well bread suspected serial killer while some may be disappointed when they realize this is not match point 2 risk addiction i thought it was proof that woody allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love this was the most i would laughed at one of woodys comedies in years dare i say a decade while i have never been impressed with scarlet johanson in this she managed to tone down her sexy image and jumped right into a average but spirited young woman this may not be the crown jewel of his career but it was wittier than devil wears prada and more interesting than superman a great comedy to go see with friends,positive
basically there is a family where a little boy jake thinks there is a zombie in his closet his parents are fighting all the time this movie is slower than a soap opera and suddenly jake decides to become rambo and kill the zombie ok first of all when youre going to make a film you must decide if its a thriller or a drama as a drama the movie is watchable parents are divorcing arguing like in real life and then we have jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film i expected to see a boogeyman similar movie and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spots 3 out of 10 just for the well playing parents descent dialogs as for the shots with jake just ignore them,negative
petter matteis love in the time of money is a visually stunning film to watch mister mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations this is a movie that seems to be telling us what money power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter this being a variation on the arthur schnitzlers play about the same theme the director transfers the action to the present time new york where all these different characters meet and connect each one is connected in one way or another to the next person but no one seems to know the previous point of contact stylishly the film has a sophisticated luxurious look we are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat the only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits a big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter the acting is good under mister matteis direction steve buscemi rosario dawson carol kane michael imperioli adrian grenier and the rest of the talented cast make these characters come alive we wish mister mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work,positive
probably my alltime favorite movie a story of selflessness sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause but it is not preachy or boring it just never gets old despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years paul lukas performance brings tears to my eyes and bette davis in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles is a delight the kids are as grandma says more like dressedup midgets than children but that only makes them more fun to watch and the mothers slow awakening to whats happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling if i had a dozen thumbs they would all be up for this movie,positive
i sure would like to see a resurrection of a up dated seahunt series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in mei grew up on black and white tv and seahunt with gunsmoke were my heros every weekyou have my vote for a comeback of a new sea huntwe need a change of pace in tv and this would work for a world of under water adventureoh by the way thank you for an outlet like this to view many viewpoints about tv and the many moviesso any ole way i believe i have got what i wanna saywould be nice to read some more plus points about sea huntif my rhymes would be 10 lines would you let me submitor leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quitif this is so then i must go so lets do it,positive
this show was an amazing fresh innovative idea in the 70s when it first aired the first 7 or 8 years were brilliant but things dropped off after that by 1990 the show was not really funny anymore and it is continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is today it is truly disgraceful how far this show has fallen the writing is painfully bad the performances are almost as bad if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guesthosts this show probably wouldnt still be on the air i find it so hard to believe that the same creator that handselected the original cast also chose the band of hacks that followed how can one recognize such brilliance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity i felt i must give 2 stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show such a huge success as it is now the show is just awful i cannot believe it is still on the air,negative
encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here i was looking forward to watching this film bad mistake i have seen 950 films and this is truly one of the worst of them it is awful in almost every way editing pacing storyline acting soundtrack the films only song a lame country tune is played no less than four times the film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme rarely have i been so happy to see the end credits of a film the only thing that prevents me giving this a 1score is harvey keitel while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort one for keitel obsessives only,negative
if you like original gut wrenching laughter you will like this movie if you are young or old then you will love this movie hell even my mom liked it great camp,positive
phil the alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlines at first it was very odd and pretty funny but as the movie progressed i did not find the jokes or oddness funny anymore its a low budget film thats never a problem in itself there were some pretty interesting characters but eventually i just lost interest i imagine this film would appeal to a stoner who is currently partaking for something similar but better try brother from another planet,negative
i saw this movie when i was about 12 when it came out i recall the scariest scene was the big bird eating men dangling helplessly from parachutes right out of the air the horror the horror as a young kid going to these cheesy b films on saturday afternoons i still was tired of the formula for these monster type movies that usually included the hero a beautiful woman who might be the daughter of a professor and a happy resolution when the monster died in the end i did not care much for the romantic angle as a 12 year old and the predictable plots i love them now for the unintentional humor but about a year or so later i saw psycho when it came out and i loved that the star janet leigh was bumped off early in the film i sat up and took notice at that point since screenwriters are making up the story make it up to be as scary as possible and not from a wellworn formula there are no rules,negative
so im not a big fan of bolls work but then again not many are i enjoyed his movie postal maybe im the only one boll apparently bought the rights to use far cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished people who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research labs located on a tropical island should be warned that this is not far cry this is something mister boll have schemed together along with his legion of schmucks feeling loneley on the set mister boll invites three of his countrymen to play with these players go by the names of today i learned schweiger udo kier and ralf moeller three names that actually have made them selfs pretty big in the movie biz so the tale goes like this jack carver played by today i learned schweiger yes carver is german all hail the bratwurst eating dudes however i find that tils acting in this movie is pretty badass people have complained about how he is not really staying true to the whole carver agenda but we only saw carver in a first person perspective so we do not really know what he looked like when he was kicking a however the storyline in this film is beyond demented we see the evil mad scientist dr krieger played by udo kier making geneticallymutatedsoldiers or gms as they are called performing his topsecret research on an island that reminds me of spoiler vancouver for some reason thats right no palm trees here instead we got some nice rich lumberjackwoods we have not even gone far before i started to cry mehehe i cannot go on any more if you wanna stay true to bolls shenanigans then go and see this movie you will not be disappointed it delivers the true boll experience meaning most of it will suck there are some things worth mentioning that would imply that boll did a good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes until the whole cromedalbino gms squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh the movie far cry reeks of scheisse that is poop for you simpletons from a far if you wanna take a wiff go ahead by the way carver gets a very annoying sidekick who makes you wanna shoot him the first three minutes he is on screen,negative
the cast played shakespeare shakespeare lost i appreciate that this is trying to bring shakespeare to the masses but why ruin something so good is it because the scottish play is my favorite shakespeare i do not know what i do know is that a certain rev bowdler hence bowdlerization tried to do something similar in the victorian era in other words you cannot improve perfection i have no more to write but as i have to write at least ten lines of text and english composition was never my forte i will just have to keep going and say that this movie as the saying goes just does not cut it,negative
this a fantastic movie of three prisoners who become famous one of the actors is george clooney and i am not a fan but this roll is not bad another good thing about the movie is the soundtrack the man of constant sorrow i recommand this movie to everybody greetings bart,positive
kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film i have ever seen sort of like a high school film project what was rosanna arquette thinking and what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed midwest town pretty hard to get involved with this one no lessons to be learned from it no brilliant insights just stilted and quite ridiculous but lots of skin if that intrigues you videotaped nonsensewhat was with the bisexual relationship out of nowhere after all the heterosexual encounters and what was with that absurd dance with everybody playing their stereotyped roles give this one a pass it is like a million other miles of bad wasted film money that could have been spent on starving children or aids in africa,negative
some films just simply should not be remade this is one of them in and of itself it is not a bad film but it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title liam neeson was excellent as he always is and most of the cast holds up with the exception of owen wilson who just did not bring the right feel to the character of luke but the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the shirley jackson story in it is attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects again i will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film but you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more,positive
this movie made it into one of my top 10 most awful movies horrible there was not a continuous minute where there was not a fight with one monster or another there was no chance for any character development they were too busy running from one sword fight to another i had no emotional attachment except to the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them scenes were blatantly stolen from other movies lotr star wars and matrix examples the ghost scene at the end was stolen from the final scene of the old star wars with yoda obee one and vader the spider machine in the beginning was exactly like frodo being attacked by the spider in return of the kings elijah wood is the victim in both films and waitit hypnotizes stings its victim and wraps them upuh hello and the whole machine vs humans theme was the matrixor terminator there are more examples but why waste the time and will someone tell me what was with the nazis nazis there was a juvenile story line rushed to a juvenile conclusion the movie could not decide if it was a childrens movie or an adult movie and was not much of either just awful a real disappointment to say the least save your money,negative
i remember this filmit was the first film i had watched at the cinema the picture was dark in places i was very nervous it was back in 7475 my dad took me my brother sister to newbury cinema in newbury berkshire england i recall the tigers and the lots of snow in the film also the appearance of grizzly adams actor dan haggery i think one of the tigers gets shot and dies if anyone knows where to find this on dvd and so on please let me knowthe cinema now has been turned in a fitness club which is a very big shame as the nearest cinema now is 20 miles away would love to hear from others who have seen this film or any other like it,positive
an awful film it must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the golden globe they have taken the story of the first famous female renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition my complaint is not that they have taken liberties with the facts if the story were good that would perfectly fine but it is simply bizarre by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film so why did they come up with this dishwaterdull script i suppose there werent enough naked people in the factual version it is hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artists life we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they would favored the rest of the film with same brevity,negative
after the success of die hard and it is sequels it is no surprise really that in the 1990s a glut of die hard on a movies cashed in on the wrong guy wrong place wrong time concept that is what they did with cliffhanger die hard on a mountain just in time to rescue sly stop or my mom will shoot stallones career cliffhanger is one big nitpickers dream especially to those who are expert at mountain climbing basejumping aviation facial expressions acting skills all in all it is full of excuses to dismiss the film as one overblown pile of junk stallone even managed to get outacted by a horse however if you an forget all the nonsense it is actually a very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that delivers as plenty of thrills and unintentionally plenty of laughs youve got to love john lithgows sneery evilness his tick every box band of baddies and best of all the permanently harassed and hapless turncoat agent rex linn as travers he may of been henry in portrait of a serial killer but michael rooker is noteworthy for a cringeworthy performance as hal he insists on constantly shrieking in painful disbelief at his captors that man never hurt anybody and whilst he surely cannot be it really does look like ralph waites frank character is grinning as the girl plummets to her death mention too must go to former londons burning actor craig fairbrass as the brit bad guy who comes a cropper whilst using hal as a human football yes you cannot help enjoy that bit hal needed a good kicking so forget your better judgement who cares if that could never happen lower your acting expectations turn up the volume and enjoy and if youre looking for qaulen he is the one wearing the helicopter,positive
i had the terrible misfortune of having to view this bmovie in it is entirety all i have to say is save your time and money this has got to be the worst bmovie of all time it should not even be called a bmovie more like an fmovie because it fails in all aspects that make a good movie the story is not interesting at all all of the actors are paperthin and not at all believable it has bad direction and the action sequences are so fake it is almost funnyalmost the movie is just packed full of crappy oneliners that no respectable person could find amusing in the least little bit this movie is supposed to be geared towards men but all the women in it are so utterly unattractive especially that old wrinkled thing that comes in towards the end they try to appear sexy in those weird horrible costumes and they fail miserably even some of the most ridiculous bmovies will still give you some laughs but this is just too painful to watch,negative
what an absolutely stunning movie if you have 25 hrs to kill watch it you would not regret it it is too much fun rajnikanth carries the movie on his shoulders and although there is not anything more other than him i still liked it the music by arrehman takes time to grow on you but after you heard it a few times you really start liking it,positive
first of all let us get a few things straight here a i am an anime fan always has been as a matter of fact i used to watch speed racer all the time in preschool b i do like several bmovies because they are hilarious c i like the godzilla movies a lot moving on when the movie first comes on it seems like it is going to be your usual bmovie down to the crappy fx but all a sudden boom the anime comes on this is when the movie goes way downhill the animation is very bad cheap even worse than what i remember from speed racer for crissakes in fact it is so cheap one of the few scenes from the movie i vividly remember is when a bunch of kids run out of a school it is the same kids over over again the fx are terrible too the dinosaurs look worse than godzilla in addition the transition to live action to animation is unorganized the dialogue voicesespecially the english dub that i viewed was horrid i was begging my dad to take the tape out of the dvd vhs player the only thing that kept me surviving was cracking out jokes comments like the robots joelmike on mst3k you pick the season honestly this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie survive it at the same time heck i am planning to show this to another fellow otaku pal of mine on halloween for a bmovie night because it is stupid pretty painful to watch unintentionally hilarious at the same time i am giving this movie a 310 an improvement from the 0510 i was originally going to give it according to my grading scale 310 means pretty much both boring bad as fun as counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it then it will become as fun as counting to 15,negative
this was the worst movie i saw at worldfest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards i can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film it is great to see jbeals but she is only in the movie for a few minutes mparker is a much better actress than the part allowed for the rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable the main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch there is no real emotional depth to the story a movie revolving about an actor who cannot get work does not feel very original to me nor does the development of the cop it feels like one of many straighttovideo movies i saw back in the 90s and not even a good one in those standards,negative
the karen carpenter story shows a little more about singer karen carpenters complex life though it fails in giving accurate facts and details cynthia gibb portrays karen was not a fine election she is a good actress but plays a very naive and sort of dumb karen carpenter i think that the role needed a stronger character someone with a stronger personality louise fletcher role as agnes carpenter is terrific she does a great job as karens mother it has great songs which could have been included in a soundtrack album unfortunately they werent though this movie was on the top of the ratings in usa and other several countries,positive
the cell is an exotic masterpiece a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer but also into one of a very talented director this is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations this is boldness at work pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent this is the best movie of the year to date i have read numerous complaints about this film anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting to negatively criticize this film is to miss the point this movie may be a landmark a tradition where future movies will hopefully follow the cell has just opened the door to another world of imagination so can we slam the door in its face and tell it and its director tarsem singh that we do not want any more personally i would more than welcome another movie by tarsem and would love to see someone try to challenge him weve all heard talk about going inside the mind of a serial killer and yes i do agree that the genre is a bit overworked the 90s were full of movies trying to depict what makes serial killers tick some of them worked but most failed but the cell does not blaze down the same trail we are given a new twist we are physically transported into the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studied i like how the movie does not bog us down with too much scientific jargon trying to explain how jennifer lopez actually gets to enter the brain of another instead she just lies down on a laboratory table and is wrapped with what looks like really long twizzlers and jaunted into another entity the cell wants to let you see what it is all about and not how it is all about and i guess that is what some people do not like true i do like explanations with my movies but when a movie ventures onto new ground you must let it do what it desires and simply take it in i noticed how the film was very dark when it showed reality maybe to contrast the bright visuals when inside the brain of another nonetheless the set design was simply astonishing i wouldnt be surprised if this film took home a few oscars in cinematography best costumes best director and the like if it were up to me it would at least get nominated for best picture i have noticed that i have kind of been repeating myself not because there is nothing else to say but because i cannot stress enough how fantastic i thought the cell was if you walk into the movie with a very open mind and to have it taken over with wonders and an eyepopping feast then you are assured a good time i guess this film was just a little too much for some people writing it off as weird or crazy i am very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind so it was right down my alley leaving the theater i heard one audience member say whoever made that movie sure did a lot of good drugs if so i want what he was smoking out of 4,positive
this film tried to be too many things all at once stinging political satire hollywood blockbuster sappy romantic comedy family values promo the list goes on and on it failed miserably at all of them but there was enough interest to keep me from turning it off until the end although i appreciate the spirit behind war inc it depresses me to see such a clumsy effort especially when it will be taken by its targets to reflect the lack of the existence of a serious critique rather than simply the poor writing direction and production of this particular film there is a critique to be made about the corporatization of war but poking fun at it in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening reminds me a bit of three kings which similarly trivializes a genuine cause for concern,negative
this movie was so frustrating everything seemed energetic and i was totally prepared to have a good time i at least thought i would be able to stand it but i was wrong first the weird looping it was like watching americas funniest home videos the damn parents i hated them so much the stereotypical latino family i need to speak with the person responsible for this we need to have a talk that little girl who was always hanging on someone i just hated her and had to mention it now the final scene transcends i must say it is so gloriously bad and full of badness that it is a movie of its own what crappy dancing horrible and beautiful at once,negative
war movie is a hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that cliched dialogue rehashed plot and overthetop action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with largescale combat once in a while however a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen the civil warera cold mountain starring jude law nicole kidman and renee zellweger is such a film then again calling cold mountain a war movie is not entirely accurate true enough the film opens with a quite literally quickanddirty battle sequence that puts glory director edward zwick shame however cold mountain is not so much about the civil war itself as it is about the period and the people of the times the story centers around disgruntled confederate soldier inman played by jude law who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of cold mountain north carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind ada monroe played by nicole kidman at first glance this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldiers tribulations on the battlefield indeed the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived cold mountain soon takes a drastic turn though as the intrepid hero inman turns out to be a deserter incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the confederates and begins a long odyssey homeward meanwhile back at the farm adas cultured ways prove of little use in the fields soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast coming to adas rescue is the course toughasnails ruby thewes played by renee zellweger who helps ada put the farm back together and perhaps more importantly cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon ada within these two settings a vivid compelling and at times very disturbing portrait of the wartorn south unfolds the characters with whom inman and ada interact are surprisingly complex enhanced by wonderful performances of brendan gleeson as rubys deadbeat father ray winstone as an unrepentant southern lawman and natalie portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother all have been greatly affected and changed by the war of northern aggression mostly for the worse the dark pervading antiwar message accented by an effective haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of virginia and north carolina is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century it is hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant director anthony minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters the love story between inman and ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film though the inherently distant abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot make no mistake cold mountain has neither the traits of a feelgood romance nor an inspiring war drama it is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether,positive
taut and organically gripping edward dmytryks crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller an unlikely message movie using the look and devices of the noir cycle bivouacked in washington dc a company of soldiers cope with their restlessness by hanging out in bars three of them end up at a strangers apartment where robert ryan drunk and belligerent beats their host sam levene to death because he happens to be jewish police detective robert young investigates with the help of robert mitchum whos assigned to ryans outfit suspicion falls on the second of the three george cooper who has vanished ryan slays the third buddy steve brodie to insure his silence before young closes in abetted by a superior script by john paxton dmytryk draws precise performances from his three starring bobs ryan naturally does his prototypical angry white male and to the hilt while mitchum underplays with his characteristic alert nonchalance his role however is not central young may never have been better gloria grahame gives her first fullyfledged rendition of the smartmouthed vulnerable tramp and as a sad sack whos leeched into her life paul kelly haunts us in a small peripheral role that he makes memorable the politically engaged dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumbs to sermonizing but it is pretty much confined to youngs reminiscence of how his irish grandfather died at the hands of bigots a century earlier thus incidentally stretching chronology to the limit at least there is no attempt to render an explanation however glib of why ryan hates jews and hillbillies and curiously crossfire survives even the major change wrought upon it the novel it is based on richard brooks the brick foxhole dealt with a gaybashing murder but homosexuality in 1947 was still beyond the pale news of the holocaust had however begun to emerge from the ashes of europe so hollywood felt emboldened to register its protest against antisemitism the studios always quaked at the prospect of offending any potential ticket buyer but while the change from homophobia to antisemitism works in general the specifics do not fit so smoothly the victims chatting up a lonesome drunk young soldier then inviting him back home looks odd even though or especially since there is a girlfriend in tow it raises the question whether this scenario was retained inadvertently or left in as a discreet tipoff to the original engine generating ryans murderous rage,positive
ardh satya is one of the finest film ever made in indian cinema directed by the great director govind nihalani this one is the most successful hard hitting parallel cinema which also turned out to be a commercial success even today ardh satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of india the film tells the reallife scenario of mumbai police of the 70s unlike any police of other cities in india mumbai police encompasses a different system altogether govind nihalani creates a very practical outlay with real life approach of mumbai police environment amongst various police officers colleagues the film describes the story of anand velankar a young hotblooded cop coming from a poor family his father is a harsh police constable anand himself suffers from his fathers ideologies incidences of his fathers atrocities on his mother anands approach towards immediate action against crime is an inert craving for his own job satisfaction the film is here revolved in a plot wherein anands constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniorsthis leads to frustrations as he cannot achieve the desired jobsatisfaction resulting from the frustrations his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms bars also turning him to an alcoholic the spirit within him is still alive as he constantly fights the system he is aware of the system of the metro where the police politicians are a inertly associated by far end his compromise towards unethical practice is negative finally he gets suspended the direction is a master piece thoroughly hard core one of the best memorable scenes is when anand breaks in the underworld gangster rama shettys house to arrest him followed by short conversation which is fantastic at many scenes the film has hairraising moments the practical approach of script is a major punch alcoholism corruption political influence courage deceptions all are integral part of mumbai police even today those aspects are dealt brilliantly finally the films belongs to the one man show om puri portraying anand velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly,positive
my first exposure to the templarios not a good one i was excited to find this title among the offerings from anchor bay video which has brought us other cult classics such as spider baby the print quality is excellent but this alone cannot hide the fact that the film is deadly dull there is a thrilling opening sequence in which the villagers exact a terrible revenge on the templars set the whole thing in motion but everything else in the movie is slow ponderous ultimately unfulfilling adding insult to injury the movie was dubbed not subtitled as promised on the video jacket,negative
one of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist the mafia middleman titta di girolamo a physically nondescript middleaged man originally from salerno in southern italy when were introduced to him at the start of the film he is been living a nonlife in an elegant but sterile hotel in the italianspeaking canton of switzerland for the last ten years conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to while this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the swiss bank who normally count di girolamos cash tell him that 10 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes at the news he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account meanwhile he tells us the spectators that when you bluff you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous he says you cannot bluff for a while and then halfway through tell the truth having eventually done this bluffed only halfway through and told the truth and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately love is exactly the reason behind the beginning of titta di girolamos troubles this initially unsympathetic character a scowling taciturn curt man on the verge of 50 a man who would not even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about at one point in his nonlife titta decides to feel concern about appearing ridiculous the first half of the film may be described as slow by some it does indeed reveal di girolamos days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined deliberate pace revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details however scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes the existence of titta di girolamo the man with no imagination identity or life the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music one theme by the scottish band boards of canada especially stood out never was the contrast between the way hollywood and italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as le conseguenze dellamore or limbalsamatore another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonists insomnia not unlike the machinist and in a far more explicit way the al pacino film insomnia le conseguenze dellamore uses this condition to symbolise a deeper emotional malaise that is been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious it is almost impossible to pinpoint its cause if indeed there is one the young and sympathetic hotel waitress sofia played by olivia magnani granddaughter of the legendary anna and the memory of tittas best friend a man whom he has not seen in 20 years unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that titta eventually though tentatively at first accepts to look through again though it is never explicitly spelt out the spectator knows that to a man like titta accepting the consequences of love will have unimaginable consequences a film without a single scene of sex or violence a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectators expectations le conseguenze dellamore is a fine representative of that small quiet discreet renaissance that has been taking place in italian cinema since the decline of cinecitta during the second half of the 70s the world is waiting for italy to produce more il postinolike fare more la vita e bellastyle films neglecting to explore fine creations like le conseguenze dellamore limbalsamatore and others your loss world,positive
i watched this film not really expecting much i got it in a pack of 5 films all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could i expect and you know what i was right they were all terrible this movie has a few and a few is stretching it interesting points the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch the drummer is very like a drummer that is damned annoying and well thats about it actually the problem is that its just so boring in what i can only assume was an attempt to build tension a whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious i had my thumb on the fast forward button ready to press for most of the movie but gave it a go and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking coz they do not half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot i thought he looked a bit like a meercat all this and i have not even mentioned the killer i am not even gonna go into it its just not worth explaining anyway as far as i am concerned star and london are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of london who was actually quite funny it was not because of their acting talent i have certainly seen a lot worse but i have also seen a lot better best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry,negative
i bought this film at blockbuster for 300 because it sounded interesting a bit ranmaesque with the idea of someone dragging around a skeleton because there was a cute girl in a miniskirt on the back and because there was a restricted viewing sticker on it i thought it was going to be a sweet or at least sincere coming of age story with a weird indie edge i was 100 wrong having watched it i have to wonder how it got the restricted sticker since there is hardly any foul language little violence and the closest thing to nudity honestly i do not usually go around hoping for it is when the girl is in her nightgown and you see her panties you see her panties a lot in this movie because no matter what she is wearing a miniskirt of some sort even the antireligious humor is tame and lame caricatured insincere derivative unoriginal and worst of all not funny in the slightestit would be better just to listen to ray stevens would jesus wear a rolex on his television show this would barely qualify as pg13 it is not rated but blockbuster refuses to let anyone under the age of 17 rent thisas if it was pornographic any little kid could go in there and rent the edited version of requiem for a dream but they insist that zack and reba is worse it is but not in that way in a way this worries methe only thing left that could offend people is the idea of the suicide at the beginning if anybody needs to see movies with honestly portrayed suicides not this one but better ones like the virgin suicides it is teenagers if both of those movies were rated r purely because of the suicide aspect then i have little chance of turning a story i have been writing into a pg13 movie the main characters are eleven and a half and twelve suicide is one of the top three leading causes of death in teenagers i think it is number 2 so chances are that most teens have been or will be affected by it just say no to this movie though 210,negative
the plot is about the death of little children hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings during the movie it appears that he has some troubles with his daughter in the end the serial killer get caught that is it but before you find out who dunnit you have to see some terrible acting by all of the actors it is unbelievable how bad these actors are including hopper i could go on like this but that to much of a waste of my time just do not watch the movie i have warned you,negative
ever watched a movie that lost the plot well this did not even really have one to begin with where to begin the achingly tedious scenes of our heroine sitting around the house with actually no sense of menace or even foreboding created even during the apparently constant thunderstorms that are strangely never actually heard in the housegreat double glazing the house that is apparently only a few miles from a town yet is several hours walk away or the third girl who serves no purpose to the plot except to provide a surprisingly quick gory murder just as the tedium becomes unbearable or even the beginning which suggests a spate of 20 killings throughout the area even though it is apparent the killer never ventures far from the house or the bizarre ritual with the salt pepper that pretty much sums up most of the films inherent lack of direction add a lead actress who cannot act but at least is willing to do some completely irrelevant nude shower scenes and this video is truly nasty but not in the way you hope given a following simply for being banned in the uk in the 80s mostly because of a final surprisingly over extended murder it offers nothing but curiosity value and one classic daft murder do not worryits telegraphed at least ten minutes before after a walk in the woods our victim comes to a rather steep upward slope which they obviously struggle up halfway through they see a figure at the top dressed in black and brandishing a large scythe what do they do slide down and run like the rest of us no of course not they struggle to the top and stand conveniently nice and upright in front of the murder weapon it really is only a movie as they say,negative
okay so this series kind of takes the route of here we go again week in week out david morses character helps out his ride who is in a bit of a pickle but whats wrong with that david morse is one of the greatest character actors out there and certainly the coolest and to have him in a series created by david koepp a great writer is heaven due to the lack of love for this show by many i cannot see it going to a season series but you never know the amount of rubbish that has made it beyond that baffles me let us hope something good can make it past a first series,positive
after sitting through this pile of dung my husband and i wondered whether it was actually the product of an experiment to see whether a computer program could produce a movie it was that listless and formulaic but the yous propaganda thrown in your face throughout the film provesdisappointinglythat it is the work of humans call me a conspiracy theorist but quotes like we have to steal the declaration of independence to protect it seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of iraq and so on the fact that nicholas cage spews lines like i would never use the declaration of independence as a bargaining chip with a straight face made me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast took valium before shooting each scene the reasoning behind each plot turn and new clue is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow and there is also a bonus side plot of misogyny with dr whateverhernamewas being chided by all involved for never shutting up she is clearly in the movie only for looks but they felt the need to slap a dr title on her character to give her some gravity at one point cages character says do not you ever shut up and the camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands like she is a child truly grotesque the only benefit to this movie was that it is so astonishingly bad you do get a few laughs out of it the really scary thing is that a majority of the people watching the movie with us seemed to enjoy it creepy,negative
it had all the cliches of movies of this type and no substance the plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie i felt like a sucker for watching it the production was good however the script and acting were bmovie quality the casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors the good actors did not hold their own nor did they lift up the others this movie is not worthy of more words but i will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines james wood and cuba gooding jr play caricatures of themselves in other movies if you are looking for mindless entertainment i still wouldnt recommend this movie,negative
this movie is based on the book a many splendored thing by han suyin and tackles issues of race relations between asians and whites a topic that comes from hans personal experiences as an eurasian growing up in china that background and the beautiful hong kong settings gives this love story a unique and rather daring atmosphere for its time other than that the story is a stereotypical romance with a memorable song that is perhaps more remembered than the movie itself the beautiful jennifer jones looks the part and gives a wonderful oscar nominated performance as a doctor of mixed breed during the advent of communism in mainland china william holden never looked better playing a romantic lead as a journalist covering war torn regions in the world the acting is top notch and the chemistry between the two lovers provides for some genuine moments of silver screen affection sure to melt the hearts of those who are romantically inclined the cinematography really brings out fiftys hong kong especially the hilltop overlooking the harbor where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments the ending is a real tearjerker some may consider sentimental romances passe but for those who enjoy classic hollywood love stories this is a shining example,positive
of all the films i have seen this one the rage has got to be one of the worst yet the direction logic continuity changes in plotscript and dialog made me cry out in pain how could anyone come up with something so crappy gary busey is know for his b movies but this is a sure w movie wwaste take for example about two dozen fbi local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer inside the jeep is ma and is confused as to why all the cops are about within seconds a huge gun battle ensues ma being killed straight off the cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them the cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bulletpellet ma is killed and gary seems to not to have noticeddamn that guy is tough truly a miracle not since the sixshooter held 300 bullets has there been such a miracle,negative
i had heard good things about states of grace and came in with an open mind i thought that gods army was okay and i thought that maybe dutcher had improved and matured as a filmmaker the film began with some shaky acting and i thought well maybe it will get better unfortunately it never did the picture starts out by introducing two elders mormon missionaries and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them instead the story degenerates into a highly improbable series of unfortunate events highlighting blatant disobedience by the missionaries something that undeniably exists but rarely on the level that dutcher portrays and it becomes almost laughable dutchers only success in this movie is his successful alienation of his target audience by unrealistically and inaccurately portraying the lives of mormon missionaries dutcher accomplishes nothing more than angering his predominantly mormon audience the film in no way reflects reality missions are nothing like what dutcher shows having served a mormon mission myself i can attest to this fact and gang life in california certainly contains much more explicit language than the occasional mild vulgarity the conclusion which i am assuming was supposed to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to all was both unbelievable cmon the entire mission gathers to see this elder sent home and the mom and the girl are standing right next to each other and cheesy next time dutcher try making a movie that someone can identify with,negative
this movie struck home for me being 29 i remember the 80s and my father working in a factory i figured if i worked hard too if i had pride and never gave up i too could have the american dream the house a few kids a car all to call my own i have noted however without a degree in something unlike my father that quit at ninth grade and a keen sense of greed and laziness you cannot get anywhere i would like to know if anyone has this movie on dvd or vhs it is made for tv and i just saw it an hour ago i see ant find it anywhere i would love to show this to my friends my pseudo friends family and other relatives see what they think and remind them that once upon a time americans would work for the sake of feeling honor and that we had pride in what we accomplished i think the feeling is still there but in a heavy downward spiral with so many things being made overseas,positive
as a disclaimer i have seen the movie 56 times in the last 15 years and i only just saw the musical this week this allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or was not in the musical however it tainted me when i watched the musical i actually believe michael douglas worked quite well in that role along with kasey i think her let me dance for you scene is one of the best parts of the movie a worthwhile addition compared to the musical the dancers and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical as well as the cast which is at least 10 times bigger easier to do in the movie of course the decors lighting dancing and singing are also much superior in the movie which should be expected and was indeed delivered the songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie the new ones are quite good ones and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion especially compared to a musical which has few decors the one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters but their dancing is impeccable and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical,positive
protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars goldie hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors the story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an arab dignitary the story goes downhill halfway through the movie and goldies charm just does not save this movie unless you are a goldie hawn fan do not go out of your way to see this film,negative
how this film could be classified as drama i have no idea if i were john voight and mary steenburgen i would be trying to erase this from my curriculum vitae it was as historically accurate as xena and hercules abraham and moses got melded into noah lot abrahams nephew lot turns up thousands of years before he would have been born canaanites wandered the earthreally what were the scriptwriters thinking was it just ignorance i remember something about noah and animals and lot and canaanites and all that stuff from sunday school or were they trying to offend the maximum number of people on the planet as possible from christians jews and muslims to historians archaeologists geologists psychologists linguists as a matter of fact did anyone not get offended anyone who had even a modicum of taste would have winced at this one,negative
preston sturgis the power and the glory was unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television in the meantime it had gained in notoriety because pauline kaels the citizen kane book had suggested that the herman mankiewicz orson welles screenplay for kane was based on sturgis screenplay here as is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the imdb web site kael overstated her case there are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of charles foster kane the newsreel representing ralston the henry luce clone thatchers memoirs bernstein jed leland susan alexander kane and raymond the butler each has his or her different slant on kane reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man and of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of kanes story this method also leads to frequent overlapping retellings of the same incident this is not the situation in the power and the glory yes like kane it is about a legendary business leader here it is tom garner spencer tracy a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country but there are only two narrators they are garners right hand man henry ralph morgan and his wife sarah padden this restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of kane in garner henry when he narrates is talking about his boss and friend whom he respected and loved his wife is like the voice of the skeptical public she sees only the flaws in henry typical example although he worked his way up tom becomes more and more antilabor in his later years unions are troublemakers and he does not care to be slowed down by their shenanigans henry describes toms confrontation with the union in a major walkout and how it preoccupied him to the detriment of his home life but henrys wife reminds him how tom used scabs and violence to end the strike apparently blowing up the unions headquarters killing many people so we have two views of the man but one is pure white and one is pure black i am not really knocking the power and the glory for not duplicating kanes success few films do including all of orson welles other films but i am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold ones interest to the end and thanks to the performances of tracy and colleen moore as his wife sally the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully brought home when they marry tom wants to do well in part to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had but in america great business success comes at a cost tom gets deeply involved with running the railroad empire he expands it and improves it constantly but it takes him away from home too much and he loses touch with sally and he also notices eve helen vinson the younger woman who becomes his mistress when sally learns of his unfaithful behavior it destroys her similarly tom too gets a full shock which makes him a martyr in the eyes of henry eve marries tom and presents him with a son but it turns out to be eves son by toms son tom jr philip trent the discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes tom to shoot himself the film is not a total success the action jumps at times unconvincingly yet it does make the business seem real note the scene when tom tells his board of directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans sturgis came from a wealthy background so he could bring in this type of detail so on the whole it is a first rate film no citizen kane perhaps but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in depression america,positive
average and surprisingly tame fulci giallo which means it is still quite bad by normal standards but redeemed by its solid buildup and some nice touches such as a neat time twist on the issues of visions and clairvoyance the genres wellknown weaknesses are in full gear banal dialogue wooden acting illogical plot points and the finale goes on much too long while the denouement proves to be a rather lame or shall i say limp affair fulcis ironic handling of giallo norms is amusing though yellow clues wherever you look 3 out of 10 limping killers,negative
return to the 36th chamber is one of those classic kungfu movies which shaw produces back in the 70s and 80s whose genre is equivalent to the spaghetti westerns of hollywood and the protagonist gordon liu the counterpart to the westerns clint eastwood digitally remastered and a new print made for the fantastic film fest this is presented in shaw scope just like the good old days this film is a simple story of good versus evil told in 3 acts which more or less sums up the narrative of martial arts films in that era act one sets up the premise workers in a dyemill of a small village are unhappy with their lot having their wages cut by 20 by incoming manchu gangsters they cannot do much about their exploitation because none of them are martial arts skilled to take on the gangsters and their boss at first they had a minor success in getting liu to impersonate a highly skilled shaolin monk one of the best comedy sequences but their rouse got exposed when they pushed the limit of credibility by impersonating one too many times act two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob however without real martial arts he embarks on a journey to shaolin temple to try and infiltrate and learn martial arts on the sly after some slapstick moments he finally gets accepted by the abbot whom he impersonated but is disappointed at the teaching methods kinda like mister miyagis style in karate kid but instead of painting fences he gets to erect scaffoldings all around the temple nothing can keep a good man down and he unwittingly builds strength endurance and learns kungfu the unorthodox way act three is where the fight fest begins with cheesy sound effects each obvious noncontact on film is given the maximum impact treatment but it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here with its wide angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners and the use of slowmotion only to showcase stunts in different angles you may find the speed of fights a tad too slow with some pause in between moves but with yuen wo ping and his style being used adnausem in hollywood flicks they sure do not make fight scenes like they used to return to the 36th chamber gets a repeat screening on monday so if youre game for a nostalgic trip down memory lane what are you waiting for,positive

bela lugosi appeared in several of these low budget chillers for monogram studios in the 1940s and the corpse vanishes is one of the better ones bela plays a mad scientist who kidnaps young brides and kills them and then extracts fluid from their bodies so he can keep his ageing wife looking young after a reporter and a doctor stay the night at his home and discover he is responsible for the brides deaths the following morning they report these murders to the police and the mad scientist is shot and drops dead shortly afterwards you have got almost everything in this movie the scientists assistants consist of an old hag a hunchback and dwarf her sons a thunderstorm and spooky passages in belas house bela and his wife find they sleep better in coffins rather than beds in the movie the corpse vanishes is worth a look especially for bela lugosi fans great fun rating 3 stars out of 5,positive

the 33 percent of the nations nitwits that still support w bush would do well to see this movie which shows the aftermath of the french revolution and the terror of 1794 as strikingly similar to the post 911 sociopolitical landscape maybe then they could stop worrying about saving face and take the awhupping they deserve it is really a shame that when a politician ruins the country those who voted for him cannot be denied the right to ever vote again they have clearly shown they have no sense of character what really stands out in this movie is the ambiguity of a character as hopelessly doctrinaire as robespierre a haunted empty man who simplistic reductive ideology cannot help him elucidate the boundaries between safety and totalitarianism execution and murder selfdefense and patriotism his legalistic litmus tests aggravate the hopeless situation he is helped create sound like any belligerent overprivileged retarded yale cheerleaders you know of wojciech pszoniak blows the slovenly deparidieu off the screen as sympathetic as robespierres plight is it is comforting to know that shortly after the film ends he will have his jaw shot off and be sent to the guillotine,negative
as someone has already mentioned on this board it is very difficult to make a fake documentary it requires tremendous skill pacing patience directorial distance a plausible premise a narrative flow and really believable acting aka great acting such is not the case with love machine it starts to show its faux hand about the 20minute mark with 60 minutes left to watch and the viewer starts to realize that he or she is being taken in it is downhill from there director gordon eriksen simply peaked too soon but to be fair to eriksen his problems started early as he explains in the extras he began wanting to do a real doc could not get funding and settled for a cheaper way of making his film the premise people who have secret lives by posting themselves on a porn website was perhaps more interesting in 199798 when the film was made eriksen does a lot of tricky stuff a pushy host handheld cameras zooms grainy blacks and whites all i guess to elicit a sense of authenticity but it just does not work the film is confusing and forced but what ultimately brings it down is the believability of the actors and the pretty awful dialogue,negative
the hills have eyes ii is what you would expect it to be and nothing more of course it is not going to be an oscar nominated film it is just pure entertainment which you can just lose yourself in for 90 minutes the plot is basically about a group of national guard trainees who find themselves battling against the notorious mutated hillbillies on their last day of training in the desert it is just them fighting back throughout the whole film which includes a lot of violence which is basically the whole film as blood and guts are constantly flying around throughout the whole thing and also yet another graphic rape scene which is pointlessly thrown in to shock the audience i would give the hills have eyes ii 4 out of 10 for pure entertainment and that only although even then i found myself looking at my watch more and more as the film went on as it began to drag due to the fact it continued to try and shock the audience with graphic gore and the occasional jump scene just to make sure the audience stays awake the hills have eyes ii is just decent entertainment something to pass time if youre bored and nothing else 410,negative
i laughed all the way through this rotten movie it is so unbelievable a woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage has a breakdown in front of a real estate office what happens the office manager comes outside and offers her a job hilarious next thing you know the two women are going at it yep they are lesbians nothing rings true in this lifetime for women with nothing better to do movie clunky dialogue like i do not want to spend the rest of my life feeling like i had a chance to be happy and did not take it does not help there is a wealthy distant mother who disapproves of her daughters new relationship a sassy black maid unbelievable that in the year 2003 a film gets made in which there is a sassy black maid hattie mcdaniel must be turning in her grave the woman has a husband who freaks out and wants custody of the snotty teenage kids sheesh no cliche is left unturned,negative
no spoilers after hitchcocks successful first american film rebecca based upon daphne dumariers lush novel of gothic romance and intrigue he returned to some of the more familiar themes of his early british period mistaken identity and espionage as the yous settled into world war ii and the large scale war effort of civilians building planes weaponry and other necessary militia the booming film entertainment business began turning out paranoid and often jingoistic thrillers with war time themes these thrillers often involved networks of deceptive and skilled operators at work in the shadows among the good law abiding citizens knowing the director was at home in this espionage genre producer jack skirball approached hitchcock about directing a property he owned that dealt with corruption wartime sabotage and a helpless hero thrust into a vortex of coincidence and mistaken identity the darker elements of the narrative and the sharp wit of literary maven dorothy parker during her brief stint in hollywood before returning to her bohemian roots in new york city who coauthored the script were a perfect match for hitchcocks sensibilities this often neglected film tells the story of the unfortunate 25 year old barry kane robert cummings who while at work at a los angeles airplane factory meets new employee frank frye norman lloydd and moments later is framed for committing sabotage fleeing the authorities who do not believe his farfetched story he meets several characters on his way to soda city utah and finally new york city these memorable characters include a circus caravan with a car full of helpful freaks and a popular billboard model patricia martin priscilla lane who during the worst crisis of his life as well as national security he falls madly in love with of course in the land of hitchcock patricia kidnapped by the supposed saboteur barry falls for her captor thus adding romantic tension to the mix in good form for this outing hitchcock brews a national network of demure old ladies average joes and respectable businessmen who double as secret agent terrorists that harbor criminals pull guns and detonate bombs to keep things moving it is a terrific plot that takes its time moving forward and once ignited culminates in one of hitchcocks more memorable finales look for incredibly life like new york city tourist attractions all of which were recreated by art directors in hollywood due to the wartime shooting ban on public attractions while saboteur may not be one of hitchcocks most well known films it is a popular bmovie that is certainly solid and engaging with plenty of clever plot twists and as usual terrific hitchcock villains remember to look for hitchcocks cameo appearance outside a drug store in the second half of the film hitchcocks original cameo idea that was shot him fighting in sign language with his deaf wife was axed by the bureau of standards and practices who were afraid of offending the deaf,positive
i just watched the dresser this evening having only seen it once before about a dozen years ago it is not a big movie and does not try to make a big splash but my god the brilliance of the two leads leaves me just about speechless albert finney and tom courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this movie the dresser is the story of sir an aging shakespearean actor finney and his dresser norman courtenay sort of a valet putting on a production of king lear during the blitz of london in world war ii these are two men each dependent upon the other sir is almost helpless without the aid of norman to cajole wheedle and bully him into getting onstage for his 227th performance of lear and norman lives his life vicariously through sir without sir to need him he is nothing or thinks he is anyway this is a characterdriven film the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters and as such it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life finney only 47 years old is completely believable as a very old very sick petulant bullying but brilliant stage actor he hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when they are taking their bows and courtenay is no less convincing as the mincing dresser who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer employer is really the wrong term to use though for although technically their relationship is that of employer and employee most of the time sir and norman act like nothing so much as an old married couple yes there are others in the cast of this movie but there is no question that the true stars are finney courtenay and the marvelous script by ronald harwood that is not to say that there are not other fine performances most notably eileen atkins as the longsuffering stage manager madge there is a wonderful scene where sir and madge talk about old desires old regrets and what might have been although it does not get talked about these days it is worth remembering that the dresser was nominated for five academy awards best actor nominations for both finney and courtenay best picture best director peter yates and best adapted screenplay i had remembered this as being a good movie but i was not prepared to be as completely mesmerized as i was from beginning to end if you want to see an example of what great acting is all about and be hugely entertained all the while then i encourage you to see the dresser,positive
what happened what we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast but somewhere the movie loses it actually it never really got going there was a little excitement when we find out that angie is not really pregnant then find out that she is after all but that was it steve martin who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie other than to make it longer i really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters kate and angie and maybe try not for a pure comedy which unfortunately it was not but maybe a drama with comedic elements i think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actresses are quite funny in their own ways and sitting here i can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a riot,negative
i have just watched fingersmith and i am stunned to see the 810 average rating for the show not only was the plot was difficult to follow but it seems character development was randomly applied the actors were adequate but in the process of attempting to create twists and turns their characters are rendered entirely one dimensional once this happens the story really falls flat and becomes tedious and just in case anyone did not see the predictable lesbian undertones from miles way this is hammered home in the most banal terms at the end of the film the end scene is disappointing and phoned in and anyone who sat back and went oh so they were carpet munchers all along must have been out for the evening two stars for the tonsil hockey in the earlier scene which was at least a bit raunchy none for the rest of it,negative
so let us begin the movie itself is as original as cronenbergs movies would usually appear my intention to see it was certainly jjl being one of my favourite actresses she is as lovely as usual this cutie i would not say it was my favourite movie of hers still it is quite interesting and entertaining to follow the rest of the cast is not extremely impressive but it is not some kind of a miscast star array recommend with confidence,positive
besides being boring the scenes were oppressive and dark the movie tried to portray some kind of moral but fell flat with its message what were the redeeming qualities on top of that i do not think it could make librarians look any more unglamorous than it did,negative
an unmarried woman named stella bette midler gets pregnant by a wealthy man stephen collins he offers to marry her out of a sense of obligation but she turns him down flat and decides to raise the kid on her own things go ok until the child named jenny trini alvarado becomes a teenager and things gradually and predictably become worse i have seen both the silent version and sound version of stella dallas neither one affected me much and i cry easily but they were wellmade if dated trying to remake this in 1990 was just a stupid idea i guess midler had enough power after the incomprehensible success of beaches to get this made this predictably bombed the story is laughable and dated by todays standards even though midler and alvarado give good performances this film really drags and i was bored silly by the end stephen collins and marsha mason both good actors do not help in supporting roles flimsy and dull reallywho thought this would work see the 1937 stanwyck version instead i give this a 1,negative
do not torture a duckling is one of fulcis earlier and honestly in terms of storyline better films and although not the typical bloodbath that fulci is known for this is still a very unique and enjoyable film the story surrounds a small town where a series of child murders are occurring some of the colorful characters involved in the investigations either as suspects or those helping the investigation or in some cases both include the towns police force a smalltime reporter a beautiful and rich exdrug addict a young priest and his mother an old man who practices witchcraft and his female protege a mentally handicapped townsman and a deafmute little girl all of these people are interwoven into the plot to create several twists and turns until the actual killer is revealed do not torture a duckling is neither a classical giallo or a typical fulci gore film although it does contain elements of both it is more of an oldfashioned murder mystery with darker subject matter and a few scenes of graphic violence although nothing nearly as strong as some of fulcis later works this is a well written film with lots of twists that kept me guessing up until the end recommended for giallomurdermystery fans or anyone looking to check out some of fulcis nonsplatter films but do not despair do not torture still has more than it is fair share of violence and sleaze some may be put off by the subject of the child killings and one main female character has a strange habit of hitting on very young boys which is also kind of disconcerting but if that type of material does not bother you then definitely give this one a look 8510,positive

i really like salman kahn so i was really disappointed when i seen this movie it did not have much of a plot and what they did have was not that appealing salman however did look good in the movie looked young and refreshed but was worth the price of this dvd the music was not bad it was quite nice usually indian movies are at least two to three hours long but this was a very short movie for an indian film the american actress that played in the movie is from the television hit series heroes ali larter her acting had a lot to be desired however she did look good in the indian dresses that she wore all the movie had not a lot to be desired and i hope salman does a lot better on his next movie thank you,negative
i am not sure why the producers needed to trade on the name of a somewhat successful movie franchise because the title suggests that it is a sequel to the first three movieswhich it is not even though marques houston did appear in hp3 he played a totally different character he was eight years older in this film okayso reid and martin werent the most talented and could not carry a film all by themselvesbut to trade on the horsepower franchise seems to me that there could have made some sort of reference albeit minor to the earlier movies i am sure everyone who wanted to see it was hoodwinkedinto thinking that they were seeing a sequelnot a totally different film with a familiar name and i am sorrykym whitley is not funny and could not hold a candle to the late robin harris ketty lester or dc curry in the earlier films although meagen good and mari morrow are a substantial visual diversioni have to give this a thumbs down just naming the film down to the last minute would have been ok furthermore the hudlin brothers who produced the first three movies were not involved in the making of this film,negative
this film laboured along with some of the most predictable story lines and shallow characters ever seen the writer obviously bought the playbook how to write a space disaster movie and followed it play by play in particular the stereotypical use of astronauts talking to their loved ones from outer space putting on a brave show in the face of disaster has been done time and time again max q appears to have been written in the hope that the producers would throw 50 million at the project but judging by the latter half of the film which contained numerous lame attempts at special effects the producers could only muster 50 thousand to learn that the film was nominated for a special visual effects emmy has me absolutely gobsmacked i think a handful of high school students with a pass in media studies could have created more believable effects and the plot holes are too numerous to mention but i will pick one out as an example now i am no nasa expert but surely it is highly implausible that a worker attached to the shuttle simulator would suddenly hold a position of power in the control room when things start to go pearshaped with the program surely there is someone more experienced at mission control who the program director would call on rather than a twentynine year old who has not been in the control room before the only saving grace for this film is the work of bill campbell he manages to make a good attempt at salvaging something out of the train wreck that is this script i give this film 2 out of 10 with the aboveaverage work of bill campbell in the lead role saving it from a lower mark,negative
caddyshack two is a good movie by itself but compared to the original it cant stack up robert stack is a horrible replacement for ted knight and jackie mason while funny just cant compete with rodney dangerfield ty webb is funny being the only character from the original most of the other characters in the movie lack the punch of the original henry wilcoxon for example except for the hystericly funny lawyer peter blunt being played by randy quaid every line he says reminds me of the originals humor especially the scene at his office i do not go in for law suits or motions i find out where you live and come to your house and beat down your door with a fing baseball bat make a bonfire with the chippindalemaybe roast that golden retriever arff arff arff then eat it and then i am comin upstairs junior and i am grabbing you by your brooks brothers pjs and cramming your brand new bmw up your tight a do we have an understanding offsetting his small role however is dan acroyd who is obviously no replacement for bill murray his voice is beyond irritating and everything he does isnt even funny its just stupid overall caddyshack ii is a good movie but in comparison to the awesome original it just cant cut it,negative
honestly this short film sucks the dummy used in the necro scene is pretty well made but still phony enough looking to ruin the viewing experience the unearthed dvd is crisp and clear and i have not made up my mind if this helps or hinders it if the film was a little grainy it might have added some creepiness factor to what was going on i have no idea why this film has so much hype surrounding it other than the subject matter but to be honest the necrophilia scenes in films like nekromantik and visitor q among others are more shocking than in aftermath all this talk about the film being about loneliness and all other manner of deep philosophy is bull this is an expensive beautifully filmed turd it is not that shocking it is not that disgusting if you insist on viewing it rent it i give it a 3 for the fact that not many people make explicit movies about necrophilia there should definitely be a bigger selection for us sickos the filming is good and it does have some gore if watching a rubbery looking doll get cut open is considered gore but other than that absolutely nothing going for this overhyped mess on the other hand genesis cerdas sequel to aftermath now available as a double feature released by unearthed films is an absolute masterpiece of a short film really showing what a good director cerda really is when given the right material although i do not care for aftermath at all genesis is so well made that i will forgive cerda and definitely keep an eye out for him in the future,negative
i thought that mukhsin has been wonderfully written its not just about entertainment there is tonnes of subtle messages that i think yasmin was trying to bring across and yes it might be confusing to some of youespecially if you did not watch sepet andor gubra for 76 times i bet you noticed how they use characters from the two movies before right its really ironic how the characters relate like the bossy neighbour is that prostitute from gubra and the chick at the snooker pad turns out to be the religious and wife of the pious man in the future and i absolutely love the voiceovers its crude yet awakeningly fresh like when they took a shot of the rumah tumpangan gamin signboard then there was suddenly mukhsins voice saying bismillahhirrahmannirrahim the scene when he climbed the tree it captured malaysians attitudeand in some mild way sniggering at how pathetic it is portrayed in the character for example even the kids can be really sharp tonguedcomplete with the shrill annoying voice and simply bad mouth people all movie long and how you can be such a busybody and talk about people when your own life is not sorted out all i can say is this movie totally reached my expectation if not exceeded it it kept me glued to the screen i could not even take my eyes off it not even to make out in the cinema ha ha,positive
i am not a golf fan by any means on may 26 about 1030 prime minister the movie started with a scene in the late 1800s old movies i like but not golf however within the first scene a young boy harry vardon is awaken by the voices of men he goes outside to inquire what they are doing and is told they are going to build a golf something so then i turned the television off but something stirred me and it was back on the movie is excellent we then see this young boy now a man professional golf player who is haunted with visions from his childhood then we meet the true focus of the movie francis and the decisions he makes for golf you meet his mother and father who want to protect him from the class thing that is so obvious during the period then there is little eddie lowery his caddy with encouraging words and little pushes that are instrumental in francis winning do not want to give away too much i was up until 2 before midday this is super please see the movie,positive
upon viewing tobe hoopers gem crocodile in 20 i developed a great interest in the collegecrocodile niche of the exploitationmonster genre i look forward to a wayward producer to follow up with several sequels to these delightful bonbons of camp goodness if only ed wood could bring his subtle sense of flair and dignity to these remarkable scripts with ed writing the scripts and a room full of monkees creating crocodile special effects on a computer all wed need would be a cast of crocky fodder with russ meyer breasts and ren hoek pectoral implants while tobe hoopers crocky opus referenced his own movies blood surf chose to dish out a bunch of aging themes from the chum bucket of other movies see if you can look past the revenge of the nerds sequel sets to find the allusionshomagesripoffs to jaws temple of doom indiana jones last crusade the convent godzilla 20 and any james bond movie also try to find the readyfortv fade where the editor gave up on making sense of the stock i was disappointed the crock did not get to try out its sotto voce tenor with a soliloquy on environmentalismor crocky appreciation but the quasicaptain ahab of the story does get his tour de force speach perhaps in the coming years well see a crock galloping off after a shootout into a golden sunset or hopefully a monkey will flush a crocky down the toilet of an international space station for midgets and enjoy the exploitative waltz of zerog monkeymidgetcrocodile bloodshed allinall the lack of a whammy bar in the surf music irked me,negative
it tries to be the epic adventure of the century and with a cast like sho kasugi christopher lee and johnrhys davies it really is the perfect badventure of all time it is actually is a pretty fun swashbuckling adventure that even with it is flaws captures your interest it must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it even if it is made in the 90s it does not have a modern feel it more has the same feeling that a old errol flynn movie had big adventure movie are again the big thing in hollywood but i am afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had this on the other hand just has the real feeling you just cannot hate it i think it is an okay adventure movie and i really love the soundtrack damn i want the theme song,positive
the last hard men finds james coburn an outlaw doing a long sentence breaking free from a chain gang do he and his friends head for the mexican border from jail and safety no they do not because coburn has a mission of revenge to kill the peace officer who brought him in and in the process killed his woman that peace officer is charlton heston who is now retired and he knows what coburn is after as he explains it to his daughter barbara hershey coburn was holed up in a shack and was involved in a waco like standoff his indian woman was killed in the hail of bullets fired it is not something he is proud of she was a collateral casualty in a manhunt lest we feel sorry for coburn he lets us know full well what an evil man he truly is heston is his usual stalwart hero but the acting honors in the last hard men go to james coburn he blows everyone else off the screen when he is on coburn gets the bright idea of making sure heston trails him by kidnapping hershey and taking her to an indian reservation where the white authorities cannot touch him he knows that heston has to make it personal then coburns gang includes morgan paull thalmus rasulala john quade larry wilcox and jorge rivero heston has chris mitchum along who is his soninlaw to be the last hard men is one nasty and brutal western andrew mclaglen directed it and i am thinking it may have been a project originally intended for sam peckinpaugh it sure shows a lot of his influence with the liberal use of slow motion to accentuate the violence of which there is a lot for a little peckinpaugh lite the last hard men is your film,positive
maybe it was the title or the trailer certainly not the interview on the dvd which is with the director as he keeps saying hi kids into the camera like a buffoon but i had expectations for entrails of a virgin to be at least a bit of sleazy fun with some good sex scenes and brutal bloody killings by a weird japanese penetrator turns out it is way too sleazy for its own good or bad or whatever there is a problem and one can see this also in the italian sexploitation flick porno holocaust similar to this in many respects in not having balance to the sex and violence too much sex and it will turn into a prototypical porno and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movies and with the killing scenes there has to be at least a little tack and maybe just a smidgen of ingenuity in creating the creaturekillerwhatever entrails of a virgin has neither it is safe to say it is a pretty soulless movie even if is not one of the very worst ever made it is there just for horndog japanese fetishists to get off on girls in trouble and men who have all their brains in their other heads in this case were given a photo team where the guys are taking some shots of some girls nothing too salacious and then by way of a dense fog they stay off at some house one night and are picked off one by one by a murderer as he is credited first off the director kazuo gaira komizu decides he has to put in a quota of random sex scenes early on we get spliced in or phoned in take your pick clips of one of the photographers having sex with one or more of the girls elsewhere it looks like it is from another movie then once settled into the house there is a wrestling scene that is poorly choreographed and shot yeah we really need to see him all there and then on to the rape and killings first the rape by the photographers who promise the girls some jobs for their time then the murderer who like damatos creature is simply covered in mud and given a stupid facial and who for an unknown reason kills the men andor rapes the women one by one now the latter of those taken by themselves should be considered the highlights of the movie this is like saying however that the croutons are the best part of a wretchedly tasting salad an eyegouging scene a spike thrown like an olympic event that scene actually is kind of cool and finally the entrailing of the overly sexcrazed girl whose inconsequential name i cannot remember even this becomes disappointing just by not being correct to the title on top of this the sex scenes which become tedious through gaira and his indulgence in longtakeswithoutcutaways where everything by the japanese censors is blurred anyway are dubbed over by the actors youd think that they seem to be enjoying themselves enough hence the need to let them speak for themselves but the overall feeling from entrails of a virgin is that of a lumpy one where it is just there to be gawked at and without a shred of suspense or true horror watch as the last girl left alive the virgin of the picture tries to stop the murderer from getting to her which lasts five minutes as she keeps throwing sticks at him you just want it to be done with for the i hate women mantra to ease up or be rid altogether,negative
the few scenes that actually attempt a depiction of revolutionary struggle resemble a hirsute boy scout troop meandering tentatively between swimming holes when sharif or please god palance try their hand at fiery oratory they sound like kurtz swallowing a bug the displays of strategic brilliance incorporate a map of cuba replete with smiling fishies in the ocean and a positively vaudevillian hypothesis on how the bay of pigs came to pass what does that leave us with one comical dentistry scene a surfeit of uppity hollywood peasants who address the camera as though it were a moving train and just for kicks a passel of homoeroticism that is not limited to castros manic and unremitting cigarfellatio never trust a medved but even a busted clock is right twice a day this is a historically awful movie,negative
this film took me by surprise i make it a habit of finding out as little as possible about films before attending because trailers and reviews provide spoiler after spoiler all i knew upon entering the theater is that it was a documentary about a long married couple and that imdb readers gave it a 78 rotten tomatoes users ranked it at 79 and the critics averaged an amazing 82 if anything they underrated this little gem filmmaker doug block decided to record his parents for posterity and at the beginning of the film we are treated to the requisite interviews with his parents outspoken mother mina and less than forthcoming dad mike i immediately found this couple interesting and had no idea where the filmmaker mike minas son doug was going to take us as a matter of fact i doubt that doug himself knew where he was going with this life takes unexpected twists and turns and this beautifully expressive film follows the journey it is difficult to verbalize just how moved i was with this story and the unique way in which it was told absolutely riveting from beginning to end and it really is a mustsee even if you are not a fan of the documentary genre this film will make you think of your own life and might even evoke memories that you thought were long forgotten 51 birch street is one of those rare filmgoing experiences that makes a deep impression and never leaves you the best news of all is that hbo had a hand in the production so instead of playing to a limited art house audience eventually millions of people will have a chance to view this incredible piece of work bravo,positive
stephen hawkings is a genius he is the king of geniuses watching this movie makes me feel dumb but it is a great movie not highly entertaining but very very intriguing the movie centers around wheelchair bound stephen hawkings a man who makes einstein look average and his theories and scientific discoveries about the universe time the galaxy and black holes everyone at sometime or another during a really intense high comes to a moment when they think theyv got the universe and the cosmos figured out and they swear as soon as they sober up they will write it all down well here is a man who actually held that feeling for more then six hours here is a man who despite suffering from lou gehrigs disease has become the greatest mind the world has yet seen watch this and listen in on how he has formulated theories on black holes awesome you would not be the same after you see it,positive
the story is about a psychic woman tory who returns to her hometown and begins reliving her traumatic childhood past the death of her childhood friend and abusive father tory discovers that her friend was just the first in a string of murders that are still occurring can her psychic powers help solve the crimes and stop the continuing murders you really do not need to find out because oh my god this was so so so so bad i know all the nora roberts fans will flock to this movie and give it tons of 10s then the rest of us will see an imdb score of 6 and actually think this movie is worth watching but do not be fooled the ending was predictable the acting terrible do not even get me started about the southern accents yall and the story was trite just rememberyou were warned,negative
oh god i must have seen this when i was only 11 or twelve do not ask how i may have been young but i was not stupid anyone could see that this is a bad movie nasty gross unscary and very silly i have seen more impressive effects at disneyland i have seen better performances at a school play and i have seen more convincing crocodiles at the zoo where they do nothing but sit in the water ignoring the children tapping on the glass the story is set in northern australia a handful of ambitious young people are trying out a new water sport surfing in shark filled waters it soon becomes evident that something more dangerous is in the water after they learn what they get the help of a grizzly middle aged fisherman who wants to kill the animal to avenge the eating of his family i think i have seen every crocodile film made in the last fifteen years the best of which is lake placid and the worse of which is its sequel blood surf would have to be the second worst croc flick i think with primeval and crocodile tailing closely behind the australian saltwater crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures out there resulting in more than a hundred injuries or deaths every year movies like blood surf however ruin not only the ferocious image of such a creature but a good hour and a half of the viewers life unless you really want to see it avoid blood surf,negative
fate leads walter sparrow to come in possession of a mysterious novel that has eerie similarities and connections to his life all based around the number 23 as the story unfolds in real life and fiction sparrow must figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually end the number 23 offers an intriguing premise that is undone by a weak execution the film just failed on many different levels which is pretty disappointing because it held so much potential the screenplay was probably the worst part about it it was filled with silly sequences and laughable dialog that just killed the mood of the movie it seemed like the screenwriter had a good idea he just did not know how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute running time the second half of the film was running low on ideas the twist was pretty obvious and the ending was awful joel schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he did redeem himself a little with phone booth and a few other films but the number 23 reminds me that he is still capable of making a stinker he has the movie drenched in style but he just cannot get a good focus he moves the film at a clunky and slow pace he switches from reality to whats actually happening in the book which quickly got annoying the actual book in the film that is titled the number 23 is an awful detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to carrey narrate it which just bored me to tears when carrey is finally done with book we get stuck watching him run around trying to solve the mystery at this point the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension we impatiently wait for the movie to reach it is horrible ending and unconvincing explanation before celebrating that film has finally finished the acting was mostly average and pretty forgettable jim carrey was clearly just sleepwalking through his performance and he did not even seem to be trying he was either completely over the top in some scenes or just very wooden his narration was a complete bore to listen to and he put no life inside his character virginia madsen did the best she could with a limited role but she needs to pick better scripts logan lerman was pretty bland as was danny huston overall the number 23 was an awful thriller that offered more laughs than suspense or thrills rating 310,negative
we brought this film as a joke for a friend and could of been our worst joke to play the film is barely watchable and the acting is dire the worst child actor ever used and hasslehoff giving a substandard performance the plot is disgraceful and at points we was so bored we was wondering what the hell was going on it tries to be gruesome in places but is just laughable just terrible,negative
this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen in my life it was stupid there was no plot and the special affects were ridiculous and i have never seen such bad acting in my life the only good part about the movie were all the hot guysespecially drew fuller i do not know what these people were thinking when they made this movie i did not even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie where the guys are all in bed touching themselves i mean it was like some kind of sick and twisted kiddy porn i would advise anyone who has heard of this movie and was interested in seeing it to just forget about it and find another movie to watch i was very disappointed the whole movie was a complete waste of time in my opinion,negative
this is a typical steele novel production in that two people who have undergone some sort of tragedy manage to get together despite the odds i wouldnt call this a spoiler because anyone who has read a steele novel knows how they all end if you do not want to know much about the plot do not keep reading gilberts character ophelia is a woman of french decent who has lost her husband and son in an accident gilbert needs to stop doing films where she is required to have an accent because she otherwise a good actress cannot realistically pull off any kind of accent brad johnson also an excellent actor is matt who is recovering from a rather nasty divorce he is gentle convincing and compelling in this role the two meet on the beach through her daughter pip and initially ophelia accuses matt of being a child molester just because he talked art with the kid all of them become friends after this episode and then the couple falls in love the chemistry between the two leads is not great even though the talent of these two people is not in my opinion a question they did the best they could with a predictable plot and a script that borders on stereotypical two people meet tragedy bigger tragedy a secret is revealed another tragedy and then they get together i wish there was more to it than that but there it is in a nutshell i wanted mindless entertainment and i got it with this in regard to the genre of romantic films this one fails to be memorable a secret affair with janine turner is far superior not a steele book as are some of steeles earlier books turned into film,negative
oh noes one of these attack of the japanese ghost girl movies i do not even remember how many i have seen maybe it sells but not to me not scary at all the japanese horror movies are have been very similar since the first one of these also the pulling of the kid i have seen that pulled under scene so many times in so many horror movies cellphone scene is also nothing new the dramaticness of the guy getting hit by a train kinda sucked i mean it lacked all dramaticness ok this is for kids 1416 who listen to japanese rock and think they are so unique well let me tell you there is a million of you d this is one of them 310 i have seen worse but you would not be missing anything by not seeing this,negative
nicholas walker is paul the local town reverand whos married to martha ally sheedy but also is a habitual womanizer and decides to fake his own death to run away with his current affair veronica dara tomanovich however in so doing he gets a about of amnesia hence the name of the film sally kirkland is also on hand as a crazy old coot who pines for the good reverand in a shades of misery type of way it is sad to see a pretty good cast wasted like this not the least bit john savage in a horridly forgettable role as a shoddy private investigator in a film billed as a black comedy one has to bring both elements into said movie while this does bring the former in spades it sadly contains none of the latter furthermore you cannot emphasize with any of the characters and as thus have absolutely no vested interest in them technically not an alltogether bad movie just an extremely forgettable one eye candy dara tomanovich gets topless sally kirkland also shows some skin my grade c where i saw it showtime showcase,negative
hollywood movie industry is the laziest one in the entire world it only needs a single hit to flood theaters with the same old crap reinvented over and over again take superheroes for example for each xman and spiderman there are daredevil elektra ghost rider and hulk japanese horror remakes are even worst it only took the ring which was pitchperfect mostly because of mister gore verbinsky to bring a ton of lookalike creepywoman based horrors eg the ring 2 the eye dark water which was fine but pointless and the grudges the first grudge was not entirely bad it was scary most of the way which is what one could expect from it plus the plot had some brains mixing narratives grudge 2 is exactly like the previous this could be a good thing but hey what boy men in black ii was it a nice thing to xerox the entire screenplay and just change the villain for the grudge 2 the critic goes the same way tired scares bad acting except for amber tamblyn and cliches all over the place three stories take place on different places and time there is aubrey tamblyn investigating what drove her sister karen sarah michelle gellar to death allison arielle kebbel who is taken by colleagues to visit the house where the incident depicted in the first movie took place and finally an american family that witness strange stuff happening on the apartment next door glad to say and i mean it that everything is tied up at the end but one must not rely on the end to make a good picture when everything else is simply tiresome and dull the chills are all over there a girl alone in the lockers someone who should not enter a house others that dig too deep meanwhile ghosts keep killing and killing and killing which seems even more deadlier than ten world wars or the ebola epidemic hey does not that seem just like another bad japanese remake something called pulse yeah day after day it is getting easier to hold a grudge against hollywood bullshits,negative
down periscope has been in our library since it first arrived in vhs since then we have acquired the dvd and a digital from cinema now it is a quirky flick that does not go militarily overboard as either pro or con it is first and foremost a comedy and as a vehicle for the main characters i am quite surprised that a sequel has never been offered the movie has gained a following that borders on a cult obsession even among the very young i became aware of this while visiting the uss drum in mobile alabama in 2002 a group of cub scouts my grandson among them had all taken up the roles from the movie and planned to relive it during their overnighter on board it is a fun romp that makes you proud both of our navy and hollywood which is rare company thanks to kelsey grammar lauren holly and rob schneider for making what could have been an otherwise unremarkable movie such great entertainment,positive
if you came here it is because youve already seen this film and were curious what others had to say about it i feel for you i really do and i profusely apologize as a canadian because that is what we do that this film ever had to cross your eyes if only for a moment i hear there is no cure for the retinal bleeding reported out of every dozen cases i like everyone else rented this movie believing it to be some stupid bmovie ripoff of blade i thought sure i could use a good laugh at a stupid movie i will give the creators of this film one positive comment about their creation thanks for removing the rec x from the bottom righthand corner of the screen i can see how that would have been a distraction from seeing this movie and for the record i saw the movie but did not watch it the dialogue was incoherent and most of the scenes took place in my grandmothers trailer i swear to god you know what i am not writing anymore about this it is just too painful,negative
deanna durbin nan grey and barbara read are three smart girls in this universal film from 1936 which introduces deanna durbin to film audiences it also stars ray milland mischa auer charles winninger john king binnie barnes and alice brady it is a sweet story about three young women now living in switzerland with their divorced mother who hear their father winninger is marrying again not having seen him in 10 years and knowing their mother still loves him they board a ship to america with the help of the housekeepernanny determined to stop the wedding realizing that the intended called precious barnes is nothing but a golddigger aided and abetted by her mother brady they arrange for her to be introduced to a wealthy count this is arranged by their fathers accountant king the man he chooses is a fulltime drunk auer but the girls mistake him for an actual wealthy count milland what a mess this is a delightful film not cloying or overly sugary at all with some nice performances particularly by auer milland barnes and brady the young women are pretty and all do good work the emphasis of course is on young durbin who is a natural actress and a beautifullytrained singer in fact her voice as a youngster is much more even than it would be as an adult she has no trouble with the high notes as she did later on because she put too much weight in the middle voice she sings a delightful il bacio in a police station one of the nicest things about the film is to see the father played by charles winninger not want his children around until he sees them and gets to know them barnes as the golddigger is not all that young but the girls mother looks way up there so the inference probably was the older man seeking his youth with a younger more glamorous woman in fact he finds the youth he was seeking in his daughters universal gives durbin the big star buildup here she has the final shot in the movie ray milland at this point was still paying his dues and it will probably be a surprise even to film fans how young and attractive he is very entertaining and of course this led to a sequel and big stardom for deanna,positive
if anyone is wondering why no one makes movies like they used to with conversation character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new better and different those folks need to take in this film and see top notch writing directing and acting that melds into a wonderful evening of observation on how things used to be in italy and england other days other times funneled into a terrific comedy of entertainment made in 1992 with alfred molina joan plowright polly walker josie lawrence jim broadbent miranda richardson and michael kitchens in the major roles under the brush stroke direction of mike newell these actors accomplish vividly memorable performances that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painters eye reminiscent of the theatrical bedroom farce of the turn of the century this film might be called a friendship farce that becomes a worthwhile experience in the growth of the romantic nature within each character and the viewer too an artistic telegram on the importance of caring about those around us,positive
i watched this series out of curiositywanting to see if they could possibly and with all this modern technologyout do cecil b demilles classic epic of 1956 starring charleton hestonyul brenner and sir cedric hardwicke of course i was let down yes they had all the biblical characters correct but they did not give us any of the spectacular theatrical scenes that held your interest throughout the first movie if you going to have a miniseries you have to have some rivoting scenes the burning bush parting the red seadrowning pharohs armies building sethis pyramids could have been done with todays technology on the scale of blockbuster movies such as lord of the rings or the matrix obviously they did not want to leave a lasting impression of faith and sacrifice which is much needed in these trouble times,negative
daniel daylewis is the most versatile actor alive english aristocratic snob in a room with a view passionate irish thief in in the name of the father an impudent violent butcher in gangs of new york in a performance ten times stronger than adrian brodys in the pianist and as the outrageous cristy brown with cerebral palsy in my left foot just to name a few his roles all influence eachother but each is seperate and utterly unique he changes completely with each character he takes on and i am beginning to believe that he can act as anything anything as cristy brown he is stunning he does not ridicule the character and he does not pity the character a difficult achievement and cristy brown comes to life a smart man an outrageous man human this movie despite small scenetransition faults and the like is an inspiration yes it is predictable but is it stupidly sentimental no i laughed i cried not a single moment of cheese proof that this is not a hollywood movie my favourite scene is the scene in the restaurant when cristy is discussing painters with eileen peter and her friends heres where daniel daylewis reaches an acting climax i will kick you in the only part of your anatomy that is animated wheel out the cripple and his performance never slows down never falters and is beautiful simply he has a lot of screen time here i watch it again again and i never get tired of cristys perspicacious eyes twitching and guttural speeches a mustsee fo sho yo,positive
my guess would be this was originally going to be at least two parts and thus at least a quarter longer because otherwise how can one explain its confused abbreviated storyline i was never completely lost but i was often partially lost and usually unclear on character motivation the movie feels as though joining plot points were dropped to squeeze it into its time slot if it were longer it might make more sense but it still wouldnt be much good the movies most interesting idea is of the war between zeus and hera as being a war between the male and female but the movie drops the ball on this making heras followers fairly horrible while not being clear on what zeus followers do or believe the movie is also interesting because you do not see the gods and there is no real certainty that they exist so it is got a couple of intriguing ideas but it does not do anything useful with them bad dialog cardboard characters and one interesting scene involving hercules and his three antagonistic sons not unwatchable but also not worth watching,negative
well i like to watch bad horror bmovies cause i think it is interesting to see stupidity and unability of creators to shoot seriously good movie i always compare this movies to for example some spielbergs works and againandagain do not understand the huge difference in what i see i like ed woods movies cause it is so inept it is very funny but people the chilling is not funny and is not even interesting it is extremely boring horror movie without anything what makes even bad movies watchable there is no acting no screenplay no direction no thrills and not even blood it is extremely inept amateurish film it is definitely the worst movie i had ever seen and i had seen a lot of worst movies believe me i warned you 110,negative
this is the worst movie i have ever seen as well as the worst that i will probably ever see i see no need to rehash what all the others have said previously just be forewarned this is not one of those bad movies you think you want to watch because you want to be able to make fun of it its just plain bad bad bad bad bad this movie is the equivalent to having a pet rock as your friend you wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for something to happen unfortunately it never does at least with a pet rock you knew what you were getting into lions gate completely deceives on this bombshell nothis is a disaster after watching this film you would swear george w bush had his hands all over the making of this film yes its that idiotic stay away unless of course you just want to watch the worst movie of all time its probably how lions gate figured it would make some money off this piece of tripe,negative
i have been a mario fan for as long as i can remember i have very fond memories of playing super mario world as a kid this game has brought back many of those memories while adding something new super mario galaxy is the latest installment in the amazing mario franchise there is much very different about this game from any other mario before it while still keeping intact the greatest elements of mario the first noticeable difference is that the story takes place in space the story begins much like any other mario game mario receives a letter from princess peach inviting him to a celebration at her castle in the mushroom kingdom upon arriving at peachs castle mario finds bowser and his son bowser jr attacking the castle with their airships bowser kidnaps princess peach and then lifts her castle up into space in the midst of the castle being lifted into space mario falls off and lands on an unknown planet mario is found by a talking star named luma and is taken back to the lumas home a floating space station here mario meets many other lumas and also meets their leader a woman named rosalina rosalina tells mario that bowser has taken away the space stations power stars and scattered them across the universe it is up to mario to help the lumas find them and save peach thus the adventure begins the way you play the game is by flying from the space station to other galaxies each galaxy consists of multiple planets that mario travels amongst in levels via these shooting stars to retrieve the power stars mario can at many times walk all the way around planets without losing gravity some planets are small and others are big many planets are similar to classic mario environments the best thing about the game are the controls all of the stuff like jumping and such is still the same but the wiimote is used in many unique ways in this game you shake the remote mario will perform a spin that is used as the primary attack in the game and it will as well activate the shooting stars you can also point the remote at the screen and use the pointer to fire star bits at enemies or objects in the environment then there is the graphics these are by far the best graphics on the wii it is just so hard to describe how great this game looks you could probably almost say it looks as good as some 360 games my only minor gripes is that the going upside down effect takes some getting used to and also the story is pretty weak the worst part is that you lose all of your lives when you turn off the game no matter how many you had when you last quit you restart at 4 lives still these minor problems aside it is a superb game that is highly entertaining and is very challenging this is the type of game that weve been waiting for on the wii a perfect 10 out of 10,positive
this short film that inspired the soontobe full length feature spatula madness is a hilarious piece that contends against similar cartoons yielding multiple writers the short film stars edward the spatula who after being fired from his job joins in the fight against the evil spoons this premise allows for some funny content near the beginning but is barely present for the remainder of the feature this films 15minute running time is absorbed by some oddball comedy and a small musical number unfortunately not much else lies below it the plot that is set up does not really have time to show but it is surely follows it plot better than many highbudget hollywood films this film is worth watching at least a few times take it for what it is and do not expect a deep story,positive
okay last night august 18th 2004 i had the distinct displeasure of meeting mister van bebble at a showing of the film the manson family at the three penny in chicago as part of the chicago underground film festival heres what i have to say about it first of all the film is an obvious rip off of every kenneth anger roman polanski oliver stone and terry gilliam movie i have ever seen second of all in a short q a session after the show mister van bebble immediately stated that he never made any contact with the actual manson family members or charlie himself calling them liars and saying he wanted nothing to do with them that the film was based on his van bebbles take on the trial having seen it all from his living room on tv and in the news and i am assuming from the autobiography and the book helter skelter which were directly mimicked through the narrative so i had second dibs on questions i asked if he was trying to present the outsider mtv sex drugs and rock and roll version and not necessarily the true story this question obviously pissed off the by now sloshed director who started shouting f you shut the f up this is the truth all those other movies are bullsh well anyway i did not even think about how ridiculous this was until the next day when i read the tagline for the film youve heard the laws side of the storynow hear the story as it is told by the manson family excuse me if this guy has never even spoken to the family and considers them to be liars that he does not want to have anything to do with how in gods name can he tell the story for them this is the most ridiculous statement i have ever heard the film was obviously catered to the sex drugs and rock and roll audience that it had no trouble in attracting to the small dimly lit theatre and was even more obviously spawned by the sex drugs and rock and roll mind of a man who could not even watch his own film without getting up every ten minutes to go get more beer or to shout some sort of rocky horroresque call line to the actors on screen this film accomplishes little more than warping the publics image of actual events which helped shape the state of america and much of the world today into some sort of slashercomic bookpornorape fantasy dreamed up by an obviously shallow individual the film was definitely very impressive to look at the soundtrack was refreshing as it contained actual samples of charlies work with the family off of his lie album the editing was nice and choppy to simulate the nauseating uncertainty of most modern music videos all in all this film would have made a much better addition to the catalogues at mtv than to the underground film festival or for that matter the minds of any intellectual observers i felt like i was at a midnight rocky horror viewing the way the audience was dressed and behaving probably the best part of the experience the cast was very good with the exception of charlie who resembled some sort of stoned dungeons and dragons enthusiast more than the actual role he was portraying the descriptions the film gave of him as full of energy throwing ten things at you and being very physical about it all the while did not match at all the slow lethargic and chubby representation that was actually presented all in all the film basically explains itself as sadie or maybe it was linda declares at the end you can write a bunch of bullsh books or make a bunch of bullsh moviesand so on and so on case in point even the disclaimer based on a true story is a dead giveaway signalling that somewhere beneath this psychedelic garbage heap lay the foundation of an actual story with content that will make and has made a difference in the world all you have to do is a little bit of alchemy to separate the truth from the the crap or actually maybe you could just avoid it all together and go read a book instead all i can say is this when the film ended i got a free beer so i am glad i went but not so glad i spent fifteen dollars on my ticket to be told to shut the f up for asking the director a question peace,negative
i bought this game on an impulse buy from walmart i am glad i did it was very entertaining listening to sean connery and playing the game i thought the graphics were the best i have ever seen in a moviegame remake the bonus levels were very hard the sniper one i think was too hard it made me so frustrated i did not play the game for a week and a half there were too many people shooting at you with nothing to hide behind or life to handle it the only thing i might change was the upgrade system i did not notice any difference from unupgraded equipment to the upgraded such as buying an armor upgrade did not seem to make the armor stronger or more filling on my life meter i really liked the q copter i think the developers did a good job,positive

it is easy to tell early in this movie exactly what will happen and who will die it is about 4 women and a man who on a vacation this was made during the end of the ultra nazi seventies when blonde women were supposedly ultra american survivors and brunettes were all deserving of death this movie like the others of that era contrives to bring this about and the viewer knows this there is no mystery or suspense the people squabble but everything is so predictable for the prejudices of the time it is laughable the five people happen upon two savage young characters and go nuts everyone is nuts so that the directorwriter team can justify their nazi propaganda for some reason the guy is attracted to the blonde who is really not much to look at and ignores a super hot looking brunette that any heterosexual man would go nuts over one must remember that in the seventies movies were meant to appeal to women and not men totally crap and totally depressing,negative
marion davies stars in this remarkable comedy show people released by mgm in 1928 davies plays a hick from savannah georgia who arrives in hollywood with her father dell henderson the jalopy they arrive in is a hoot as is davies outrageous southern costume davies lands a job in slapstick comedy not what she wants but it brings her success she meets fellow slapstick star william haines who is immediately smitten with her well davies then gets a job at a more prestigious studio high art studios and lands a job in stuffy period pieces a handsome but fake actor andre telefair shows her the ropes of how to be the typical pretentious hollywood star davies abandons her slapstick friend and father for the good life but of course learns that is not who she really is marion davies is wonderful throughout as she outrageously runs the gamut of emotions required of a serious actress william haines is his usual wonderful comedic self and there are cameos by charles chaplin john gilbert and other famous stars of the day including the director of the film king vidor this is a silent film with a few sound effects as sound pictures were just coming into their own a treasure of a film,positive
the performance of every actor and actress in the film are excellently natural which is what movie acting should be and the directing skill is so brilliantly handled on every details that i am never tired of seeing it over and over again however i am rather surprised to see that this film is not included in some of the actors and director attenboroughs credits that puzzles me are not they proud of making a claim that they have made such excellent long lasting film for the audience i am hoping i would get some answers to my puzzles from some one possibly one of the knowledgeable personnel insider of the film,positive
while star trek the motion picture was mostly boring star trek the final frontier is plain bad in this terrible sequel the crew is on shore leave when they get a distress signal from the federation that ambassadors representing earth romulus and kronos the klingon home world have been kidnapped by a renegade vulcan bent on his quest to attain a starship to venture into the great barrier there he hopes to find god using mysticism and bad writing he persuades many of the senior officers of the enterprise to betray kirk and get a hold of the ship they do reach the inside of the great barrier and find a planet where they do meet a godlike alien this one is so bad it is hard to figure out where to begin at the core is a good idea that is never really developed the plot goes nowhere instead of where no man has gone before it is almost like the writers had no idea how to end this fiasco the action scenes do not have the suspense of wrath of kahn the philosophy is boring and the humor is stale now i will focus most of my anger on william shatner when he takes the directors chair the ego gets bigger most of the focus is on him spock and mccoy but does not give the others enough to do moreover whereas shatner is usually guilty of overacting in previous movies and television spots he is just plain bad in this one now kirk is reckless a practical jokers and silly one of the worst scenes involves the three leaders singing the song row row row your boat in a round by a campfire in any case this is the worst of the star trek franchise i should have given it three out of ten instead of five,negative
despite later claims this earlytalkie melodrama has very little in common with citizen kane it is a biopic of a ruthless but human fictional plutocrat told in flashback but hopping around time the scriptwriter preston sturges shows none of his later gift for sparkling dialog and none of the myriad cinematic innovations of kane are evident still it is very watchable with a young spencer tracy his oldman makeup makes him look just like well an old spencer tracy showing depth and authority and colleen moore a little past her prime and not physically well matched playing a multifaceted womanbehindtheman there is also helen vinson as one of the most treacherous femmes fatales in movie history sending the final third into ecstatic soapopera reverberations the surviving print is jumpy and has missing audio snippets and there are some plot holes left open how would she know whose son it was if she is sleeping with both of them and the music is awfully hokey for all that i was quite fascinated,positive
this is the best version so far that you will see and the most true to the bronte work dalton is a little tough to imagine as rochester who jane eyre declared not handsome but his acting overcomes this and zelah clark pretty as she is is also a complete and believable jane eyre this production is a lengthy watch but well worth it nearly direct quotes from the book are in the script and if you want the very first true romance in literature this is the way to see it i own every copy of this movie and have read and reread the original the filming may seem a little dated now but there will never be another like this,positive
apparently the people that wrote the back of the box did not bother to watch this socalled movie they described blindingly choreographed intrigue and violence i saw no intrigue i instead saw a miserable attempt at dialogue in a supposed kung fu movie i saw no violence at least i saw nothing which could cause me to suspend my disbelief as to what could possibly hurt a man with impervious skinbut here i am perhaps revealing too much of the plot furthermore as a viewer of many and sundry films some of which include the occasional kung fu movie i can authoritatively say that this piece of celluloid is unwatchable whatever you may choose to do i will always remain correct jonathan tanner ps i was not blinded by the choreography,negative
i liked boyles performance but that is about the only positive thing i can say everything was overdone to the point of absurdity most of the actors spoke like you would expect your 9yearold nephew to speak if he were pretending to be a jaded stonehearted cop or an ultraevil villain the raspy voiceovers seemed amateurish to me i could go buy a cheap synthesizer and crank out better opening music and whats with the whole 1984ish police torture stuff it was totally superfluous and had nothing to do with the actual events of the story cox added a lot of things in fact that he apparently thought would be really cool but had nothing to do with the story that is a big disappointment because one of the things that makes borges stories so good is his minimalism they are tightly bound with no superfluous details this movie is just the opposite i stopped watching after the scene where lonnrot is questioning the guy from the yidische zaitung or thereabouts i wasted 4 renting this but at least i can get some satisfaction from writing this review and hopefully saving others from making the same mistake,negative

so well made no cgi crap has anyone else been on the jumping crocs tour of darwins adelaide river before black water was way realistic rogue was a bit cringeworthy thought the blonde chick was excellent in it have not really seen her before and the other chick is a babe she is always excellent v suspenseful i would compare it to jaws over any other man eating animal flick got the hole aussie thing down pat without going ott with struths and crikeys as well loved it,positive
the assignment is an outstanding thriller with several plot twists driven by character rather than star turns the need to stage special effects obligatory romance and endless car chases however there is a car chase in here and a dandy it is aidan quinn is wonderful as both the terrorist and the naval officer recruited to eliminate him it is rare that a second or third tier actor such as quinn is given an important starring role like this that carries a film usually such a role is given to an alist actor with box office draw which is probably why i never heard of this film before i saw it donald sutherland is great as the morally ambiguous somewhat creepy at times agent that recruits quinn ben kingsley is fine also as the israeli agent the plot is very complex and there are multiple story lines which converge in gradual fashion toward the end and not all at once as were used to seeing the paranoia and claustrophobia of these type of thrillers is captured and portrayed with both moral ambiguity and frightening intensity the locations are convincing and effective the soundtrack is nothing special but rarely do we get all of the above mentioned qualities these days without dumb andor meaningless plot developments unconvincing star turns loud annoying music video type soundtracks a villain that hams it up and repeatedly a cast costumes and plot that cater mostly to an audience under 25 this is an outstanding thriller which most assuredly did not get its just due upon its release 12 of 4 stars,positive

set in the 1794 the second year of the french republic formed after the execution of louis xvi this film portrays the power struggle between the revolutionary leaders danton gerard depardieu at his finest and robespierre a commanding performance by the polish actor wojciech pszoniak the moderate revolutionary danton has returned to paris from his country seat where he has been since being deposed as leader of the committee of public safety in the previous year by robespierre he is opposed to the reign of terror which has resulted in the executions of thousands of citizens mainly by guillotine who are thought to be opposed to the revolution danton is confident of the support of the ordinary people and tries to persuade robespierre to curb the bloodletting but robespierre and the committee are afraid that the popularity of danton will lead to them being overthrown and put danton and his supporters on trial for being traitors this was the first french language film made by andrzej wajda after he had arrived in france from poland his polish film company was closed down by the government due to his support for the solidarity trade union which had opposed the polish government in the late seventies and early eighties his previous film man of iron 1981 had dealt with the solidarity union and its leader lech walesa and it is easy to draw comparisons between the relationship of walesa and the polish leader general jaruselski and that between danton and robespierre dantonwalesa are the voice of reason opposed to robespierrejaruselski who continue dictatorial rule despite having lost the support of the people they claim to represent the film is based on the polish play the danton affair written by stanislawa przybyszewska in the 1930s and on its release the film was criticised by some for being static and theatrical but what the film does is to concentrate on the behindthescenes meetings of the committees and the scenes in the national assembly and the courtroom rather than the activities on the streets of paris,positive
usually i am a bit of a fan of the bad eighties early nineties film featuring now has beensbut this film is so incredibly terrible that it was a real endurance test to sit through guys dressing up as girls has been done to death but never so pathetically corey haims performance was abysmal as usual nicole eggert was not much better this has no redeeming qualities even if you are a number 1 fan of an actoractress in this piece of trash stay away,negative
i have now seen quite a few films by pedro almodovar but this would have to be the most disappointing so far this film seemed to lack the zaniness that is usually everywhere in his films and the story just never got me interested many almodovar regulars appear in this film so it is not like there was a lack of onscreen talent but this film just seemed more serious than his other films if there was a comedic edge to this movie i certainly could not find it and it made for one surprisingly weak movie,negative
i greatly enjoyed margaret atwoods novel the robber bride and i was thrilled to see there was a movie version a woman frames a cop boyfriend for her own murder and his buddy an excop journalist tries to clear his name by checking up on the dead womans crazy female friends it is fortunate that the movie script fixes miss atwoods clumsy plotting by focusing on the story of these two men victims of scheming women heh okay you got me if these guys are mentioned in the book and i am pretty sure they are entirely made up for the movie i will eat the dust cover of my hardback copy apparently the three main female characters of the novel are not enough to carry the movie zenias manipulations are not interesting unless we see them happen to a man and a mans life is screwed up roz charis and toni tell their stories to a man because it is not important if a man does not hear them i liked the characters in the book it hurts to see them pushed off to the side for a mans story i normally do not look for feminist angles on media and i tried to enjoy the movie as is if i had not read the book i might have enjoyed the movie a lot more so if you like the cop and the excop and you want to read more about them youre out of luck read the novel if you want to enjoy luscious prose and characterization subtly layered through a plot it is the same plot the movie excavated it ironed it and sprinkled it with male angst it is like zenias revenge on margaret atwood,negative

ingrid bergman playing dentist walter matthaus faithful receptionist who harbors a little crush on her boss is absolutely wonderful in this film she handles the witty repartee in the script with aplomb and steals a terrific scene where she and goldie hawn talk in a record booth ingrids monologue is a front but her face tells you she believes in it with all her heart matthau is an odd choice for the leading man he is too old for goldie hawn and too unrefined for bergman not to mention too unfocused to be a dentist but i liked the way he tries hard to please goldie and stumbles around trying to free himself from a lie hawn who won a supporting oscar is just as fresh and bubbly as she is today this bedroom farce is not terribly sophisticated and faintly reminds one of any wednesday besides but it is a welcome relief from the noisy teenoriented comedies they turn out today cactus flower is a lovely sigh from,positive
a bored television director is introduced to the black arts and astral projection by his girlfriend learning the ability to separate his spirit from his body the man finds a renewed interest in his life and a sense of wellbeing unfortunately the man discovers while he is sleeping his spirit leaves his body and his uncontrolled body roams the streets in a murderous rampage according to the dvd sleeves synopsis the synopsis is not entirely correct as it turns out anyway the movie opens with a dizzying outofbody example of handsome director winston rekert as paul sharpes newly discovered astral body experience it also foreshadows an upcoming dogfight young andrew bednarski as matthew sharpe being a kid draws pictures of the blue man as his murder spree begins handsome detective john novak as stewart kaufman discovers the victims are connected to mister rekert mister novaks investigation leads to the supernatural a prime example of which is karen black as janus with whom rekert fears he is falling in love several in the cast perform well but the blue man winds up tying itself up in a knot aka eternal evil its unsatisfying story tries to be far too clever for its own good,negative
ah yes the 1980s a time of reaganomics and sly chuck and a host of other action stars hiding in a remote jungle blowing away commies at the time i couldnt believe how movies like rambo missing in action and uncommon valor and who can forget the ridiculous red dawn made money at the box office theyre turgid action crap fests with a rather off putting right wing agenda and they have dated very badly tromas war is a tongue in cheek take on these type of movies but youve got to ask yourself did they need spoofing in the first place of course not tromas war lacks any sort of sophistication though it does make the point that theres no real difference between right wing tyrants and left wing ones and sometimes feels more like a grade z movie than a send up maybe it is,negative
this tale based on two edgar allen poe pieces the fall of the house of usher dance of death poem is actually quite creepy from beginning to end it is similar to some of the old blackandwhite movies about people that meet in an old decrepit house for example the cat and the canary the old dark house night of terror and so on boris karloff plays a demented inventor of lifesize dolls that terrorize the guests he dies early in the film or does he and the residents of the house are subjected to a number of terrifying experiences i would not go into too much detail here but it is definitely a mustsee for fans of old dark house mysteries watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened room dan basinger 810,positive
i am so happy and surprised that there is so much interest in this movie jack frost was my introduction into the films produced and distributed by apix entertainment and without exception everything this company deals with is pure crap first and this is very important never ever watch this movie sober why would you unlike many other entertaingly bad movies this one i feel was made intentionally bad i just cannot get over how fake the snowman is which is why its always shown only briefly the way it moves is the best this movie is way better than the michael keaton piece of crap becuz that was made too be a good movie and that version is as bad as this,negative
revolt of the zombies proves that having the same director revamp and recycle an idea does not necessarily make lightning strike twice the halperin brothers responsible for the horror classic white zombie made this trite piece of garbage a mere few years later to cash in on its popularity and even recycled closeups of lugosis eyes from that previous film there was a court battle with the white zombie films rights owners who did not want the halperins to be able to use the word zombie in this title that word was the only thing that could help this film because as everyone knows bad films can make much more money simply by having the word zombie appear in the title knowing what victor halperin was capable of a few years before only makes this uninteresting film more insulting it seems he never directed another horror film after this debacle the zombies here seem not to be true walking dead but simply hypnotism victims wanna create a mindcontrolled army of zombies be ready to crack a few eggs including your own the lame plot man falls in love with scheming woman who plays with his heart and becomes engaged to him only to make his friend whom she loves jealous this sends man into a spiral of madness in which he tries using zombie mindcontrol techniques to change things to his advantage in an attempt to win over a woman who is not worth spit this includes one of the most blatantly obvious plot developments i have ever seen youd have to be blind or stupid not to see the ending coming the acting is not even good this movie makes the racially insensitive king of the zombies which appeared on the same double bill dvd i bought seems like an atmospheric horror masterpiece by comparison and reminds us that not every black and white film is a classic it makes the atomic age scifi alien zombie cheese fest invisible invaders seem like a serious drama this is one big ball of cheese so ridiculously melodramatic it could probably make many a korean film fan twitch south korean films are often known for their use of melodrama the credits list the ironically named company favorite films i am not sure whose favorite film this would be but they are obviously an idiot not recommended for fans of zombies romance or classic films,negative
the complaints are valid to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for women i am okay with these night time soaps like greys anatomy or ugly betty or west wing because there are stories that are interesting even with the given that they will never end however when the idea parallels the daytime soaps aimed at just putting hunky men taye diggs tim daly and chris lowell into sexual tension and romps and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a socalled little hospital it seems like general hospitalor a female counterpart to baywatch that was what men wanted and they had it so if this is what women want so be it but the idea that this is a high brow show or something men will watch is unrealistic,negative
this movie was one of the best movies that i have seen this year i did not see any cameos in the movie but it is still pretty good it is similar to anchorman in the humor department but i think this is a better put together movie it actually has a point if you are going to see a whole bunch of ta you will be disappointed just a well put together movie if you have nothing to do for the day or you need a lot of humor you will find this to be a really good movie i definitely think that ebert and roepers review of this movie is right on i mean i do not really like ebert on most movies but this is the movie that i will agree about the movie contains a good enough story that it is actually believable that these type of people are out there there is definitely something to be said about how they treat virginity in this movie yea sure you get laughed at when it is found out about but it still suggests that you wait steve did a wonderful job of portraying the person that he did in this movie and yet it is still funny,positive
i remember seeing this film in the mid 80s thought it a well paced and well acted piece i now work quite often in berkeley square and the had to get a copy of dvd to remind myself how little the area has changed although my office is newish it just 30 seconds away from the bank even jack barclays car dealership is still there selling bentleys and rolls royces it is look like the dvd is due a region 2 release soon the region 1 copy i is very poor quality let us hope they have cleaned it up only the slightly dodgy escape sequence from the court spoils what would otherwise be a great film but i guess is in line with the caper tag the film goes with,positive
two hours ago i was watching this brilliant movie which overwhelmed me with its imprisoning photography it is quite understandable how it won the prize of best camera in cannes 20 close ups predominated it close ups of walls humans and of many other things the warm colored lighting which is also usually by the director gave the movie a warm atmosphere only two persons are principally to be seen in most of it an interesting music and especially three songs or themes accompanied the movie nearly all the time each one of these themes represented a certain atmosphere during the whole movie silence and slow movements characterize the movie some scenes were extended moments or a serious of closeups not only tony leung deserves a prize for his superb acting since maggie cheung was also so brilliant i wonder how many dresses she was wearing in the different scenes the story was also connected somehow with the history of hong kong and the region the 1960s this prevented me from understanding some details of the it especially at the end in short i would recommend the fans of artistic movies to watch it in the cinema,positive
luckily for bill murray this is such a lightweight project since he pretty much has to carry it meatballs is the story of lowrent camp northstar and how its counselors deal with the campers as well as one another then there is much made of their wealthy rivals from across the lake named camp mohawk which culminates in a twoday olympiad competition above it all is bill murray clowning around and making a pretty memorable film debut the film is sprinkled with mediumsized laughs chuckles and more than a few guffaws along the way the biggest laughs come from the pranks played on the nerdy camp director three of them involve the counselors moving his bed outside in various locations while he is sleeping morty or micky as everyone calls him wakes up along the side of a road strung up in some trees several feet above the ground and finally floating on a raft in the middle of the lake there are also some funny moments involving the counselors hitting on one another but this is a pg rated film with little in the way of raunchiness the film takes a serious note involving a shy camper named rudy who is played by chris makepeace of course it is up to murray to teach the kid how to open up and give him the confidence he needs to run a marathon during the olympiad the sentimentality of rudys situation seems tacked on to a great degree notice how when murray first sees the kid sitting alone in the grass after getting off the bus he tells him you must be the short depressed kid we ordered makes you wonder if that line was really in the script or murray was just adlibbing while the cameras were rolling in other words murray might as well have said to makepeace you must be that actor we hired to play the stereotypical lonely kid you see in most summer camp films who does not fit in but before it is all over murrays performance makes this plot device more than bearable he really seems to have some good chemistry with makepeace the film culminates with the games between the two rival camps very little of the events we are shown are even slightly believable but it just does not matter this is a pretty good film on many levels do not let the absurd 56 rating this film is currently getting scare you off murray will keep you laughing throughout just be warned avoid the sequels especially the one with corey feldman 8 of 10 stars the hound,positive
the danish bladerunner is boldly stated on the box are you kidding me this film is a complete drag when i am thirsty and go for a soda in the kitchen i usually pause the vcr so i would not miss anything not this time i actually found myself looking long and hard in the fridge just so i wouldnt have to go back why the hell is there not one sciencefictionscriptwriter out there who has the vaguest clue about how computers work it is mindboggling one of the premises of film is that our hero whos a hacker has a little computerassistant to help him the microsoft office paperclip finally caught on in the future when he loses the assistant in the movie he is helpless and cannot get into any computers he is a hacker it is like saying that you cannot drive your car if you do not have your lucky drivingcap on i would not even go into the lightningeffect when he recieves electroshock,negative
this movie shows a clip of live animal mutilation of an animal getting hacked by a machete and getting its skin ripped off i know these horrible things happen in the world but im watching movies based on the fact that what im watching is not actually happening on the screen these live animal clips are not meant to be in movies they are meant to show people that belong to certain organizations to help the horrible things that humans to do other species this should be banned and destroyed i have also contacted netflix and other resources to collaborate getting this movie off the market this movie should be removed from the public the person who made this movie needs psychological help,negative
anyone who thinks kool moe dee carol alt and corey feldman comprise a list of good actors must be smoking something i would love to try sometime where to begin lousy soundtrack hammy acting action in places this is the typical amateurishly written hack fodder that washedup hasbeen and neverwass love to star in i actually felt embarrassed for the stars in this film the only thespian missing to top this turd was gary coleman who if he would have been in the movie would have made it at least somewhat howlingly bad rather than just plain bad there was one part in the film where carol alt screamed do you think i am an idiot yes carol i do your agent does and please for the love of all that is decent and holy go away and stop degrading yourself like this this film is something anna nicole smith would take part in i would tell you what the plot was but that would be one more sentence fragment to this article plus my mind drifted many times during the movie anyway so i barely paid attention,negative
this film could have been a decent remake and gosh knows it tried or miss english tried assembling talented actors together with a successful experienced writerdirector should be a formula for a decent film but miss englishs experience according to her imdb bio is exclusively limited to television work and it is glaringly obvious throughout this film i am surprised that none of the reviews i have read mention what i found most unlikeable about this film and what kept it from reaching even a portion of its potential it looked and felt like it was made for television to give some credit to miss english many of the jokes that simply did not work on a movie screen would have been terrific on tv and maybe a laugh track would have helped so much of the camera usage and the lighting would have played out fine on tv but looked awkward or odd on a big screen if the whole film had been chopped up into a miniseries or a sitcom i think it could have worked but this is cinema and sadly miss englishs talents did not translate i cringed at so many different points in my embarrassment for the actors the writers that i felt like i came out of the theater half shriveled meg ryan is her usual perky cute self except for the awful plastic surgery she has had on her face but where did she have a chance to use her talent she has made films where she does not recreate her stereotyped role and done them well but not here annette bening seemed to simply go through the motions such a great talent and yet such a poor performance i enjoyed the other women characters but they were more caricature than substance and it was sad to see what worked in this film in the 1930s does not translate to the 20s and no one helped miss english get the changes updates or subtleties right if only she as writer director and producer had reached out for some assistance i think it could have been good but it was not it is so frustrating to go to a movie that has good stars and a good writer or director and come away feeling it was a waste of everyones time money this new yorker cartoon i saw yesterday is appropriate a few movie execs are having a meeting the caption reads let us remake a classic with worse everything,negative
i find it very intriguing that lee radziwill jackie kennedys sister and the cousin of these women would encourage the maysles to make big edie and little edie the subject of a film they certainly could be considered the skeletons in the family closet the extra features on the dvd include several contemporary fashion designers crediting some of their ideas to these oddball women i would say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion by these designers fascinating that is are they nuts or am i missing something this movie is hard to come by netflix does not have it facets does though,positive
cmon guys some previous reviewers have nearly written a novel commenting on this episode it is just an old 60s tv show this episode of star trek is notable because of the most serious babe yeoman barrows ever used on star trek and the fact that it was filmed in a real outdoor location unlike the tng and voyager series which were totally confined to sound stages this use of an outdoor location and babe gives proper depth and an almost film like quality to a quite ordinary episode of this now dated and very familiar show except a few notable exceptions that is the city on the edge of forever assignment earth and tomorrow is yesterday the old series of star trek needs to be seriously mothballed and put out of it is boring misery half a dozen good episodes from 79 is quite a poor batting average this is typical of the boring stuff gene roddenberry produced back then actually contrary to popular belief where some people worshiped the ground he walked on he actually made a lot of rubbish he does not deserve to be spoken of in the same breath as irwin allen for example just look at the set of the bridge of the enterprise from a modern point of view they used wobbly plywood for the floor cafeteria chairs with plastic backs and cheap cardboard above the instrument panels you can clearly see the folds in the paper every expense spared or what,negative
i just watched this movie on it is premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia i liked not loved mork mindy as a kid mostly for robin williams zany energetic performance this movie made me remember why was the original show great not really but robin certainly was which brings me to this movie i was pleasantly surprised expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show which in a way it was but of course the real focus was on robin it was interesting to see robins journey from struggling street jester to national tv star and how such a drastic difference affected him and his long suffering wife and my hat is off to star chris diamantopoulos as he portrayed mister williams with integrity sensitivity and heart not just a cute impression although it was even deadon on an unrelated note i noticed that robins struggles were in some ways similar to andy kaufman who was underappreciated by network tv and held back creatively but that is the taxi behind the scenes biopic all in all this was a very enjoyable flick in which i felt i got to know a little more of the man behind the orkan the acting was solid by all never melodramatic like i suspected and the story moved along well performances that were particularly good were by those who played garry marshall and john belushi the scene in which belushi heckles robin was a hoot not a great masterpiece by any means i would have liked to have seen a tad more about after midday dawber but definitely watchable especially for those robin williams and mork mindy fans out there nanoo nanoo,positive
i caught this film on azn on cable it sounded like it would be a good film a japanese green card i cannot say i have ever disliked an asian film quite the contrary some of the most incredible horror films of all time are japanese and korean and i am a huge fan of john woos hong kong films i an not adverse to a light hearted films like tampopo or chung king express two of my favourites so i thought i would like this well i would rather slit my wrists and drink my own blood than watch this laborious badly acted film ever again i think the director steven okazaki must have spiked the water with quaalude because no one in this film had a personality and when any of the characters did try to act as opposed to mumbling a line or two their performance came across as forced and incredibly fake i honestly did not think that anyone had ever acted beforethe only person who sounded genuine was brenda aoki i find it amazing that this is promoted as a comedy because i did not laugh once even more surprising is that cbs morning news called this a refreshing breath of comedy it was neither refreshing nor a breath of comedy and the ending was very predictable the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think such things avoid this film unless you want to see a boring predictable plot line and wooden acting i actually think that spike of bensonhurst is a better acted film than thisand i walked out half way through that film,negative
before i begin let me get something off my chest i am a huge fan of john eyres first film project shadowchaser the film a bgrade cross of both the terminator die hard may not be the work of a cinematic genius but is a hugely entertaining action film that became a cult hit spawned two sequels a spin off judge and jury begins with joseph meeker a convicted killer who was sent to death row following his capture after the socalled bloody shootout which seems like a poor name for a killing spree meeker kills three people while trying to rob a convenience store being led to the electric chair there is an amusing scene where meeker talks to the priest about living for sex but meeting his one true love who was killed during the shootout expressing his revenge for the person who killed her michael silvano a washedup football star who spends his days watching his son alex practicing football with his high school team and ends up harassing his sons coach but once executed meeker returns as a revenant or as kelly perine calls a hamburger without the fries whose sole before midday is to get his revenge which basically means making silvanos life a misery let me point out the fact that judge and jury is not a true horror film it is a supernatural action film with meeker chasing silvano using his ability to change form which amounts to david keith dressing up as everything from an elvis impersonator a french chef with an accent as bad as his moustache a drag queen a clown a standup comedian a shotgun which fires explosive rounds an invulnerability to death although that does not stop martin kove from shooting keith with a desert eagle to pay silvano back for killing meekers wife director john eyres does not seem interested in characterisations instead focusing solely on action scenes which the film has plenty of but that is the films main flaw since there is nothing to connect the action scenes together the acting is surprisingly good with keith delivering the best performance supported ably by kove as well as paul koslo who plays the washedup cop quite well kelly perine is annoying as the cabbie who tries to help but makes the situation worse,negative
ye lous film purple butterfly pits a secret organization purple butterfly against the japanese forces in war torn shanghai ding hui zhang ziyi and her exlover hidehiko itami toru nakamura find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict after a chance meeting i agree with the reviewer from paris the film substitutes a convoluted semihistorical conflict for a plot without giving the audience a single reason to care about the characters or their causes the sudden time shifting does not help matters as it appears completely unwarranted and pointless normally i do not mind dark movies but the absence of light the bonejarringly shaky camera footage and the generally bad filmmaking techniques really make this a tough film to watch and stay interested in i also agree with the viewer from georgia that this film has a chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography but i do not think that helps the movie the backdrop to the film is one of the most potent events of the 20th century and i do not believe you can do it any justice by editing it as if it were a michael bay film the overly melodramatic moments do not add to its watchability the actors are all suitably melancholy zhang ziyi once again shows that she has an exceptionally limited acting range as she spends the entire movie doing what she seems to do best in all her films brooding and looking generally annoyed however at least she adds some variety to this role by chainsmoking and engaging in the worst lovemaking scene since michael biehn and linda hamilton in the terminator all in all a very disappointing film especially seeing as how it comes from the director of suzhou he 210,negative
after hearing about george orwells prophetic masterpiece for all of my life i am now 37 but never having read the book i am totally confused as to what i have just seen i am very familiar with the concepts covered in the novel as i am sure most are but only through hearsay and quotes without this limited knowledge this film would have been a complete mystery and even with it i am still no more educated about the story of 1984 than i was before i watched it on the plus side the cinematography is amazing hurt burton deliver fine performances and the overall feel of the movie is wonderfully grim and desolate the prostitute scene was a fantastically dark piece of film making now for the down sides and there are plenty there is a war going on at least as far as the propaganda is concerned but why with who nothing is explained there are a couple of names bandied about eurasia and so on but they mean nothing without explanation who is winston what does he do where does he come from where does he work why is he changing news reports why is not he on the front line why does not he eat the food in the canteen what is that drink he is drinking through the entire film why is he so weak ill why is not he brainwashed like the rest of them whats the deal with his mother sister what happened to his father a little back story would have been nice no scrub that essential for those like myself that have not read the book without it this is just a confusing and hard to follow arthouse movie that constantly keeps you guessing at what is actually going on the soundtrack was thisjointed and badly edited and the constant chatter from the big brother screens swamps the dialogue in places making it even harder to work out whats going on i accept that this may have been an artistic choice but it is very annoying all the same also i know this has been mentioned before but why all the nudity it just seemed totally gratuitous and felt like it had been thrown in there to make up for the lack of any plot coverage i personally cannot abide the way hollywood feels it has to explain story lines word for word these days we are not all brainwashed simpletons but this is a few steps too far the other way i can only imagine that it totally relies on the fact that youve read the book because if this film really is the literal translation that i have seen many people say i would find it very hard to understand why 1984 is hailed as the classic it is there is no denying that it was light years ahead of it is time and has pretty much predicted every change in our society to date maybe this has been a sort of bible to the powers that be but many scifi novelists have done the same without leaving gaping holes in the storyline i guess i have to do what i should have done from the start and buy a copy of the book if i am to make any sense out of this all in all very disappointed in something i have waited for years to watch,negative

i just got back from this free screening and this osama witch project is the handsdown worst film i have seen this year worse than even catwoman which had the decency to at least pass itself off as fiction in september tapes a film crew of documentary journalists heads to afghanistan despite being thoroughly unprepared for the trip the conditions and oh yeah the psychotic and ridiculous vendetta of their filmmaker leader to avenge his wifes death on sept 11 to track down osama bin laden they made eight tapes on their journey which now document their travels and of course their attempts to kill the terrorist leader the eight tapes thankfully all end at points significant in the narrative which is convenient for a documentary the psychotic idiotic protagonist who is given to long significant speeches that he probably learned watching macgyver cares nothing for his own life or the life of his innocent crew as he gets them further and further into danger through a series of completely dumb mishaps i do not know why he did not just wear a sign on his back that said shoot me the crews translator supposedly their sensible voiceofreason does little more than whine and gets baffled as the idiot hero leads them into doom you wish they would brought along someone on their trip to call them all morons around tape 4 i began rooting for the terrorists to shoot the film crew,negative
i remember seeing this film in the theater in 1984 when i was 6 yearsold you do the math i absolutely loved it i was tarzan for the 2 weeks after seeing it climbing the furniture jumping around making monkey sounds it started a fascination with tarzan and monkeys but oddly enough a longer lasting love for christopher lambert keep in mind that i saw highlander very shortly after this 1984 was the last time i saw that film until about a month ago it happened to be on cable as i was getting ready for bed at 330 am and even though it was late and i was tired and i had to be at work at 900 am i stayed up to watch this movie that i loved as a kid upon viewing it i realized that it was not that great of a film and even odder then that that andie macdowells voice was dubbed by someone else ian holme was of course solid as usual and surprisingly the monkey suits still kind of held up but what was most surprising was how good lambert was as tarzan he was great the depth he managed to capture in so few lines his primal body language and most importantly his ability to bring this character through its extremely large ark were just amazing as i stated earlier i am lambert fan but i am used to highlander the hunted and fortress in this film he was really quite good and it is a shame that he never got a chance to portray a character with such depth again so to make a short story way too long i was a little disappointed that the film was not that good but i was glad to see that lambert was good and i do not regret staying up until 600am to see it,positive

francis ford coppola wrote and directed this stunningly personal story of a married womans flight from her husbandand the reality that perhaps the youthful glee and excitement of her younger years are behind her we learn little about this womans marriage except that she has been feeling her independence slipping away as of late she is also recently learned she is pregnant which has further complicated her heart she does not want to be a complacent wifey despite the maternal way she speaks to her husband over the phone she meets two men on her journey a former college football hero whoafter an accident during a gamehas been left with permanent brain damage and a sexy strutting motorcycle cop who has a great deal of trouble in his own life the clear clean landscapes as photographed by the very talented wilmer butler are astutely realized as are the characters shirley knight james caan and robert duvall each deliver strong gripping performances most especially since these are not very likable people in conventional terms some scenes such as knights first call home from a payphone or her first night alone with caan where they play simon says are almost too intimate to watch coppola toys with reality turning the jagged memories of his characters into scrapbooks weve been made privy to he allows scenes to play out yet the editing is quite nimble and the film is never allowed to get too heavy there are at least two or three very frisky moments it is a heady endeavorso much so that the picture was still being shown at festivals nearly five years later some may shun coppolas unapologetic twisting of events in order to underline the finale with bitter irony however the forcefulness and drive behind the picture nearly obliterate its shortcomings from,positive
this movie was not very well directed they almost totally disregarded the booki guess they were trying 2 save time the only upside 2 me was that the actor who played finny was cute some of the dialog between the main characters appeared a little gay which was not the case in the book major parts of the book were once again chopped outyou lost the over all effect it was not as haunting as the book and left me lacking severely also the strong language although it was brief was very unnecessary also i was surprised not pleasantly by a new character that was no where in the bookone of my favorite characters leper was poorly interpreted and portrayed he seemed more sinister in the movie than the real leper was in the book over all disappointing,negative
